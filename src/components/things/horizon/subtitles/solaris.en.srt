Part One

20
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:05,509
Kris, come here!

21
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:08,679
You're just in time.

22
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:11,807
He takes a walk every morning
for at least an hour.

23
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,685
I forbade him to come back earlier.

24
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,896
He's had a lot of work,
sometimes staying up all night.

25
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:20,566
These Solarists!

26
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:25,821
He reminds me of a bookkeeper,
preparing his accounts.

27
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:29,199
We expected you yesterday.

28
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:31,910
He wanted to run away
when he saw me.

29
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:37,207
Hello.

30
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,046
Hello.

31
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:51,180
I probably shouldn't have
bothered you today.

32
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:59,313
How old you and I have become.
I've only just realized that.

33
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,191
What are you apologizing for?

34
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:04,610
Does he understand
that everything depends

35
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,612
on his first report
from the station?

36
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:10,574
Everything we've received so far
has been confusing or incomprehensible.

37
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:13,619
If he confirms that the work
can't continue for some reason,

38
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:17,331
the station can be taken
out of Solaris' orbit.

39
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:21,210
He understands.

40
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:24,004
You promised to talk to him.
I brought the film.

41
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:27,132
That's what I came here for.
- Yes, of course.

42
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:32,387
Can the boy stay with you
for a few days?

43
00:08:32,638 --> 00:08:35,432
I have a lot to do
and no one to leave him with.

44
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:40,020
Anna will look after him.
She'll have more free time now.

45
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,573
When does he leave?

46
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:55,160
He'll be gone by tomorrow morning.

47
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:08,840
It's so pleasant here.

48
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:13,720
This house reminds me
of my grandfather's house.

49
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,556
I really liked it.

50
00:09:15,806 --> 00:09:19,101
So we decided
to build one just like it.

51
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,853
I don't like innovation.

52
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,069
I'd better get going.

53
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:57,574
I have a lot to do.

54
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:02,704
Don't you want to see this?

55
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:05,290
I've already seen it many times.

56
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:12,214
On the 21st day of our expedition,

57
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:16,176
radiobiologist Vishyakov
and physicist Fekhner

58
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:20,722
went on an exploratory flight
over the Solaris Ocean in a hydroplane.

59
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:28,605
When they failed to return after
16 hours, we declared an emergency.

60
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:36,822
The fog was thick and we were forced
to call the search off.

61
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:41,118
All of the rescue craft
returned to the station

62
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:44,871
except for the helicopter
operated by Burton.

63
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:47,582
Burton returned an hour after dark.

64
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:52,462
Once out of the helicopter,
he ran to his quarters.

65
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:54,589
He was in a state of shock.

66
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:56,007
This was highly unusual

67
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:58,343
for a man with 11 years
of experience flying in space.

68
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:01,263
He recovered in a couple of days,

69
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:04,891
but he would never leave the station

70
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,519
and refused to approach the window
overlooking the Ocean.

71
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:10,230
Later he wrote to us from the clinic.

72
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:12,482
He was preparing a statement
of great importance,

73
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:16,361
one that would decide
the fate of Solaristics.

74
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:19,281
Excellent.
Let's hear what he has to say.

75
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:26,538
At this time,
let us give the floor to Burton.

76
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,498
Thank you.

77
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:39,926
When I first descended
below 300 meters,

78
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,304
I had trouble maintaining altitude.

79
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,056
There was a strong wind.

80
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:51,062
All of my attention went towards
operating the ship.

81
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:54,816
I did not look out of the cabin.

82
00:12:57,027 --> 00:13:01,448
As a result, I wound up in a fog.
- Was it an ordinary fog?

83
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:02,949
Of course not.

84
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,285
It seemed to be colloidal and viscous.

85
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:08,955
It coated all of the windows.

86
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:15,337
Because of the fog's resistance,
I began to lose altitude.

87
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:18,799
I couldn't see the sun,

88
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:25,472
but the fog glowed red
in its direction.

89
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:30,560
After half an hour
I came out into a large, open space.

90
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:36,316
It was almost round,
a few hundred meters across.

91
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:43,865
At that point,
I noticed a change in the Ocean.

92
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,243
The waves disappeared.

93
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:49,996
The surface became almost transparent,
with clouded patches.

94
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:53,500
Yellow sludge gathered beneath it.

95
00:13:55,502 --> 00:14:01,132
It rose up in thin strips
and sparkled like glass.

96
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:06,513
Then it began to seethe,
boil and harden.

97
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,724
It looked like molasses.

98
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:14,020
This sludge or slime
gathered into large lumps

99
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:18,775
and slowly formed
different shapes.

100
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:21,152
I was being drawn into the fog,

101
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:28,159
so I had to struggle
against this for some time.

102
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:34,374
When I looked down again,
I saw a sort of garden.

103
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,293
A garden?

104
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,045
Attention, please.

105
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:43,049
I saw shrubs, hedges,
acacia trees, little paths.

106
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:47,304
Everything was made
of the same substance.

107
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:51,558
Did these trees and plants
have leaves?

108
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:54,811
These shrubs and acacias?

109
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:58,940
No, I already said they were all made
of plaster, but life-sized.

110
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:03,445
Then everything began
to crack and break.

111
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:09,200
Yellow sludge poured out of the fissures.

112
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:12,329
Everything began to boil even harder,
and foam appeared.

113
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:16,833
You can see for yourselves.

114
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,085
I used a camera from time to time.

115
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:23,298
Everything I saw before and after
should be on film.

116
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:26,092
Then I propose we interrupt
these discussions

117
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:32,098
and see everything with our own eyes.

118
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:38,980
All right, show us your film.
This is very interesting.

119
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:18,038
Is that it?

120
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,790
That's all of your film?

121
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,417
Yes, that's everything.

122
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:27,547
But we don't understand.
You filmed clouds.

123
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:30,925
Why did you film clouds?

124
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:35,180
That must be the fog
I told you about.

125
00:17:38,183 --> 00:17:40,060
I wasn't expecting this.

126
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:46,066
All of this could be the result
of Solaris' biomagnetic current

127
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:48,693
acting on Burton's consciousness.

128
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:52,906
We now know the current is not only
a gigantic cerebral system,

129
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:55,075
but a substance capable
of thought processes.

130
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:57,535
That hypothesis is questionable.

131
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:01,915
Were you feeling sick that day?

132
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:05,585
The next part is meaningless.

133
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:12,592
Let's pick up here.

134
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:16,179
I discovered something floating
in one of the openings.

135
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:20,600
It looked like Fechner's space suit.

136
00:18:21,184 --> 00:18:24,479
Its shape was that of a person.

137
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:29,109
I turned around –
I didn't want to lose sight of that spot.

138
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:34,197
At that moment,
the figure rose slightly,

139
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:39,869
as if it were swimming
or treading the waves.

140
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:47,127
This person had no space suit,
and he was moving.

141
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:49,129
I don't understand. "Person"?

142
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:51,840
Yes, person.

143
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:58,096
Just a minute.
Did you see his face?

144
00:18:58,263 --> 00:18:59,013
Yes.

145
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07,480
What person?

146
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:13,903
Who was it?

147
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:17,991
It was a child.

148
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:20,910
What child?
Had you seen him before?

149
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:24,789
No, never.
In any case, not that I remember.

150
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,501
When I flew closer to him,

151
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,423
I noticed something awful.

152
00:19:33,882 --> 00:19:35,049
What do you mean?

153
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:41,556
I couldn't make it out at first.

154
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:47,937
Then I saw that he was
unusually large. Gigantic.

155
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:52,775
He was about four meters tall.

156
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:58,448
He had blue eyes

157
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:00,700
and dark hair.

158
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,827
Perhaps you're not feeling well?

159
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:08,666
We'll postpone the meeting.

160
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:12,170
I'll continue.

161
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:23,306
He was naked, absolutely naked,

162
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:27,602
like a newborn.

163
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:31,481
He was wet, or rather, slippery.

164
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,359
His skin was shiny.

165
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:40,615
He rose and fell like the waves,
but he was moving by himself.

166
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:42,242
It was disgusting.

167
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:56,881
I'm sorry.
I'll jump ahead a little.

168
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:00,635
There isn't much more.

169
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:07,350
Burton's statements appear to be
the result of a hallucinatory complex

170
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,519
brought on
by the planet's atmosphere,

171
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:12,105
as well as symptoms of depression

172
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:15,775
exacerbated by inflammation
of the associative zone

173
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:18,152
of the cerebral cortex.

174
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:21,739
This report in no way,
or in almost no way,

175
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:24,534
corresponds with reality.

176
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:27,412
What do you mean "almost"?

177
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:32,625
Excuse me, I'm not finished yet.

178
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,670
Professor Messenger
offers a different opinion.

179
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:39,799
He believes that Burton's statements
could be founded in reality

180
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:44,429
and merit further study.

181
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:45,930
That's it.

182
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:49,559
I saw it all with my own eyes.

183
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:56,316
I would like to offer
another opinion.

184
00:21:57,191 --> 00:22:00,194
We stand on the brink
of an enormous discovery,

185
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:05,950
Our decision should not rely
on the observations

186
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,955
of a man without
any scientific qualifications.

187
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:16,085
Although any researcher
may envy this pilot,

188
00:22:16,461 --> 00:22:20,548
his presence of mind,
his gift of observation.

189
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:24,969
Moreover, in light
of recent information,

190
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:31,434
we are morally obligated
to continue the exploration.

191
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:36,606
I can understand
how Professor Messenger feels.

192
00:22:36,731 --> 00:22:39,484
I understand him.

193
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:42,862
But let's take a look
at the road we've traveled.

194
00:22:43,321 --> 00:22:45,990
Solaristics is exactly
where it began.

195
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:49,494
Years of work have been in vain.

196
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:58,378
Everything we now know
about Solaris is negative

197
00:22:58,628 --> 00:23:03,466
and has come to resemble a mountain
of disjointed, incoherent facts

198
00:23:03,758 --> 00:23:07,220
that strain credulity.

199
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:12,350
We're in exactly
the same situation today.

200
00:23:13,518 --> 00:23:15,395
Solaristics is degenerating.

201
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:19,357
But what we're talking about
is far more serious

202
00:23:20,358 --> 00:23:23,403
than just the study of Solaristics.

203
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:27,782
We're talking about the boundaries
of human knowledge.

204
00:23:28,116 --> 00:23:30,159
Don't you think that
by establishing artificial barriers

205
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,286
we deliver a blow
to the idea of limitless thought?

206
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:38,668
By limiting our movement forward,
we facilitate moving backwards.

207
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:41,504
I nevertheless repeat my question.

208
00:23:41,796 --> 00:23:44,132
What do you mean by saying

209
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:46,759
the report of my observations in almost
no way corresponds with reality?

210
00:23:47,427 --> 00:23:52,140
I saw everything with my own eyes.
What do you mean by "almost"?

211
00:23:52,557 --> 00:23:57,061
"Almost no way" means
that some real phenomena

212
00:23:57,437 --> 00:24:00,314
could have triggered
your hallucinations, Burton.

213
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:04,026
When it's windy,

214
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:09,157
it's easy to confuse a swaying bush
with a living being,

215
00:24:09,699 --> 00:24:12,827
to say nothing of a foreign planet.

216
00:24:13,536 --> 00:24:17,039
I meant no offense, Burton.
None.

217
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:22,170
I'd like to know what impact
Professor Messenger's opinion will have.

218
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,589
Practically none,

219
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:30,553
which means that exploration
in this area will be discontinued.

220
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:32,555
Just a moment. Yes...

221
00:24:32,722 --> 00:24:34,599
I'd like to make a statement.

222
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:37,101
The commission has not offended me,

223
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:39,353
but it has offended
the spirit of the expedition.

224
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:41,481
Therefore, I consider it
my duty to announce...

225
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:45,735
And so on...

226
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:51,240
Nowadays it's considered
good manners to laugh

227
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:53,993
when Burton's report is mentioned.

228
00:24:56,621 --> 00:24:58,372
Thank you, Burton.

229
00:24:58,748 --> 00:25:01,876
We've known you for a long time,
but I never knew anything about you.

230
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:08,090
You know, you were very handsome.

231
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:11,761
That's not true,
but thanks anyway.

232
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,763
Excuse me.

233
00:25:19,894 --> 00:25:22,522
Well, Kris, what do you think?

234
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:26,400
If you don't mind,

235
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:30,905
I'd like to speak to your son alone.

236
00:25:31,781 --> 00:25:35,618
I don't want to look like an idiot
in front of you yet again.

237
00:25:38,538 --> 00:25:41,290
I'll wait for you outside by the swing.

238
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:49,173
What a ridiculous man.

239
00:25:49,674 --> 00:25:52,927
You have no reason to say that.

240
00:25:53,928 --> 00:25:56,055
He's ill at ease.

241
00:25:56,556 --> 00:25:59,559
He thinks he's getting
in the way of our farewell.

242
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:04,939
He's a tactful man.

243
00:26:04,939 --> 00:26:09,193
If he decided to come, it's because
he considers this important.

244
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:15,074
Although, I admit,
I'd rather not see anyone now.

245
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:17,910
You and I rarely get
a chance to talk.

246
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:26,961
I'm glad to hear you say that.

247
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:30,172
Even if it's on the last day.

248
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,103
The last day.

249
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:53,613
One always feels awful
after a big farewell.

250
00:26:55,615 --> 00:26:57,116
Here comes your aunt.

251
00:26:57,241 --> 00:27:00,453
Let's meet after lunch.
We need to talk.

252
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:05,750
Why did you have to invite this Burton
today of all days?

253
00:27:07,585 --> 00:27:11,464
Where are the guests going to sleep?
Next to you, or in the room upstairs?

254
00:27:13,633 --> 00:27:15,009
Upstairs, I guess.

255
00:27:17,261 --> 00:27:20,723
Well, I'm off to my meeting
by the swing.

256
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,767
- Maybe...
- Just a moment.

257
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:28,230
You and your rooms can wait!

258
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:39,241
Listen, Kris...

259
00:27:57,635 --> 00:27:59,428
What happened?

260
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:02,932
- What's standing over there?
- What are you afraid of?

261
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:04,809
In the garage, staring at me.

262
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:06,185
It's a horse.

263
00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:08,896
Don't. I've seen it already.

264
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:10,439
Come on.

265
00:28:14,068 --> 00:28:19,448
He's gentle.
Look how beautiful he is.

266
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:29,458
You understand, I think
Solaristics has reached an impasse

267
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:32,545
as a result
of irresponsible daydreaming.

268
00:28:33,963 --> 00:28:35,297
I'm interested in the truth,

269
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:38,968
but you want to turn me
into a biased supporter.

270
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:45,474
I don't have the right to make decisions
based on impulses of the heart.

271
00:28:45,975 --> 00:28:47,977
I'm not a poet.
I have a concrete goal:

272
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,938
Either stop the research
and remove the station from orbit,

273
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:54,734
thereby legitimizing
the Solaristics crisis,

274
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:57,486
or take extreme measures.

275
00:28:57,737 --> 00:29:00,948
Perhaps bombard the Ocean
with heavy radiation.

276
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,700
- Not that!
- Why not?

277
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:07,329
Didn't you say research
should continue at any price?

278
00:29:07,872 --> 00:29:13,377
You want to destroy that which we are
presently incapable of understanding?

279
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:18,466
Forgive me, but I am not an advocate
of knowledge at any price.

280
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:23,888
Knowledge is only valid
when it's based on morality.

281
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:29,268
Man is the one who renders science
moral or immoral.

282
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:31,103
Remember Hiroshima.

283
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:33,606
Then don't make science immoral.

284
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:35,399
It's strange...

285
00:29:39,153 --> 00:29:41,530
Strange.
There's nothing strange about it.

286
00:29:44,158 --> 00:29:47,995
You yourself can't be sure
that what you saw

287
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:51,248
wasn't just hallucinations.

288
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:52,666
Thank you very much.

289
00:29:52,917 --> 00:29:54,752
It's seems there's
nothing more to discuss.

290
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:01,884
- What happened?
- I'm leaving.

291
00:30:02,176 --> 00:30:03,427
Where are you going?

292
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:08,390
He's an accountant, not a scientist.
You were right.

293
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:11,268
You and I are friends, but that doesn't
mean you can say that about him.

294
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:15,773
Great. You and I have known each other
for 20 years. It had to end someday.

295
00:30:16,816 --> 00:30:18,943
Are you leaving the boy?

296
00:30:31,205 --> 00:30:34,333
What did you have to offend him for?
You're too harsh.

297
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:38,587
It's dangerous to send
people like you into space.

298
00:30:38,921 --> 00:30:42,216
Everything there is too fragile.
Yes, fragile!

299
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:46,220
The Earth has somehow
become adjusted to people like you,

300
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,597
although at what sacrifice!

301
00:30:48,973 --> 00:30:52,977
What, are you jealous that he'll be
the one to bury me, and not you?

302
00:31:10,995 --> 00:31:15,749
Thus, it had been established that
the Solaris Ocean is a distinctive brain.

303
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:19,753
Right after that, an even more daring
hypothesis came out,

304
00:31:20,129 --> 00:31:22,965
suggesting that the Ocean
is a thinking substance.

305
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:27,761
Incidentally, this hypothesis

306
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:32,016
still cannot be confirmed or refuted.

307
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:35,102
It's a program about Solaris.

308
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,898
There are few believers left.

309
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:43,027
First of all, there are those connected
to the fate of the Solaris station.

310
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:45,529
On this huge station
built to house 85people

311
00:31:45,738 --> 00:31:48,407
there is now a crew of three.

312
00:31:48,782 --> 00:31:51,035
They are: astrobiologist Sartorius,

313
00:31:51,994 --> 00:31:53,537
cyberneticist Snaut,

314
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:58,792
and physiologist Gibarian,
who deal with the problem...

315
00:31:59,293 --> 00:32:01,545
I'm calling from the city.

316
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:03,172
Burton.

317
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:08,427
Anna, leave for a minute.
We need to talk.

318
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:20,439
I didn't talk to Kris
about what was most important:

319
00:32:21,315 --> 00:32:25,945
about Messenger, who voiced
a different opinion at that meeting.

320
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:31,909
He became very interested in Fechner,
who died in the Solaris Ocean.

321
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:36,664
It turns out that Fechner
has an orphaned son.

322
00:32:37,081 --> 00:32:40,042
He had left his family.

323
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:46,090
Messenger and I paid a visit
to Fechner's widow,

324
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:50,094
and I saw this boy with my own eyes.

325
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:52,179
You never told me about that.

326
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:53,973
I never got the chance.

327
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:58,102
Fine. Go on.

328
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:03,607
This child was identical
to the one I saw on Solaris.

329
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:07,111
Of course,
he wasn't four meters tall.

330
00:33:08,946 --> 00:33:12,074
He shouldn't think about this
too much before liftoff,

331
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:16,370
but he should keep it in mind.

332
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:06,011
There's no point
in keeping these papers.

333
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:09,097
The ones to hold on to are in my room.

334
00:39:27,157 --> 00:39:31,661
My research notes, my thesis...
I held on to so much.

335
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,548
If something should happen,
I'll find someone to take care of them.

336
00:39:45,384 --> 00:39:47,052
I'll come up with something.

337
00:39:47,928 --> 00:39:51,765
Don't look for that film.
I'm taking it with me.

338
00:39:51,932 --> 00:39:53,642
Remember?
The one of the bonfire?

339
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:55,936
Yes, of course.

340
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:08,461
- Ready, Kelvin?
- Ready, Moddard.

341
00:43:08,878 --> 00:43:10,714
Don't worry about a thing.

342
00:43:11,006 --> 00:43:14,259
Have a great trip.
Send our regards.

343
00:43:14,718 --> 00:43:19,347
- When is liftoff?
- You're already flying, Kris! Take care.

344
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:55,634
Solaris station! Do something!

345
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:59,929
I'm losing stability.
This is Kelvin, over.

346
00:45:53,293 --> 00:45:55,295
Hey, where is everyone?

347
00:45:55,754 --> 00:45:58,173
You've got guests.

348
00:47:28,638 --> 00:47:30,265
Dr. Snaut?

349
00:47:56,416 --> 00:47:57,917
Snaut?

350
00:48:06,926 --> 00:48:09,679
I'm Kelvin, the psychologist.

351
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:14,642
It looks like you weren't
expecting me.

352
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:20,273
Did you receive the radiogram?

353
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:27,906
Yes, of course.

354
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:44,213
What's with you?

355
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:51,846
Forgive me.

356
00:48:54,098 --> 00:48:57,310
Where's Gibarian?
Where's Sartorius?

357
00:48:57,727 --> 00:48:59,354
Sartorius is in his quarters.

358
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:01,356
Gibarian is dead.

359
00:49:01,731 --> 00:49:03,107
What do you mean "dead"?

360
00:49:07,195 --> 00:49:08,112
Suicide.

361
00:49:12,992 --> 00:49:14,619
I beg your pardon.

362
00:49:15,495 --> 00:49:17,705
I knew Gibarian
and he would never have...

363
00:49:17,872 --> 00:49:22,335
He was almost always
in a state of deep depression

364
00:49:23,503 --> 00:49:27,757
ever since these disturbances began...

365
00:49:32,512 --> 00:49:35,723
Why don't you go rest, take a bath?

366
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:40,103
Take any room
and come back in an hour.

367
00:49:41,521 --> 00:49:46,359
I would like to see Gibarian –
I mean, Sartorius.

368
00:49:46,651 --> 00:49:47,777
Later.

369
00:49:48,152 --> 00:49:51,030
I doubt he'd see you now.
He's upstairs, in the laboratory.

370
00:49:51,906 --> 00:49:53,282
Listen, Snaut,

371
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:59,247
I understand that something extraordinary
has happened and maybe...

372
00:50:05,753 --> 00:50:07,755
Dr. Kelvin...

373
00:50:10,633 --> 00:50:15,930
You understand...
Come back in an hour. Please.

374
00:50:17,765 --> 00:50:20,268
Go and rest.

375
00:50:21,936 --> 00:50:26,315
Listen, there are only three of us:
you, me and Sartorius.

376
00:50:26,649 --> 00:50:29,318
You know us from our photographs.

377
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:32,321
If you see something
out of the ordinary,

378
00:50:32,822 --> 00:50:36,784
something besides me and Sartorius,
try not to lose your head.

379
00:50:36,826 --> 00:50:38,077
What would I see?

380
00:50:38,578 --> 00:50:41,956
I don't know.
That sort of depends on you.

381
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:43,082
Hallucinations?

382
00:50:43,458 --> 00:50:47,670
No. Just remember.

383
00:50:48,171 --> 00:50:50,840
- Remember what?
- That we're not on Earth.

384
00:50:52,467 --> 00:50:56,554
You know, it would be better if you
came back in the evening, or at night.

385
00:50:56,971 --> 00:50:59,974
No, let's make it tomorrow morning.

386
00:52:42,827 --> 00:52:49,667
A. GIBARIAN

387
00:52:52,795 --> 00:52:59,969
HUMAN BEING

388
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:34,128
FOR K. KELVIN

389
00:53:47,225 --> 00:53:49,602
Hi, Kris.

390
00:53:57,401 --> 00:53:59,779
I still have a little time left.

391
00:54:00,279 --> 00:54:02,615
There are some things
I must tell you,

392
00:54:03,366 --> 00:54:05,618
and some things
I must warn you about.

393
00:54:06,285 --> 00:54:10,414
By now you're at the station
and know what happened to me.

394
00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:14,794
If not, Snaut or Sartorius
will tell you.

395
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:20,925
What happened to me...

396
00:54:23,636 --> 00:54:25,304
is not important.

397
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:29,558
Or rather, it cannot be explained.

398
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:33,437
I'm afraid that what happened to me
is only the beginning.

399
00:54:35,815 --> 00:54:38,818
I wouldn't, of course,
want it to happen...

400
00:54:39,277 --> 00:54:43,572
but this could happen to you
and the others.

401
00:54:44,448 --> 00:54:49,829
Here, it could probably
happen to anyone.

402
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:52,707
Just don't think
that I've lost my mind.

403
00:54:52,832 --> 00:54:55,835
I'm of sound mind, Kris.
Believe me.

404
00:55:00,464 --> 00:55:01,966
After all, you know me.

405
00:55:05,469 --> 00:55:09,181
If I have enough time,
I'll tell you why I did everything.

406
00:55:09,598 --> 00:55:13,936
I'm telling you this so that,
if it does happen to you,

407
00:55:14,103 --> 00:55:17,857
you'll know it's not madness.

408
00:55:17,982 --> 00:55:19,692
That's the most important thing.

409
00:55:20,109 --> 00:55:24,447
As for continuing research,

410
00:55:24,739 --> 00:55:27,616
I'm leaning towards
Sartorius' proposal,

411
00:55:27,992 --> 00:55:32,747
subjecting the Ocean's plasma
to heavy radiation.

412
00:55:34,123 --> 00:55:38,753
I know it's prohibited,
but there's no other choice.

413
00:55:38,753 --> 00:55:39,253
We...

414
00:55:41,255 --> 00:55:43,382
You will get mired in it.

415
00:55:46,385 --> 00:55:51,515
It may offer a way
of breaking this deadlock.

416
00:55:53,142 --> 00:55:56,896
This is our only chance
to make contact with this monster.

417
00:55:57,021 --> 00:55:58,647
There is no other choice, Kris.

418
00:56:00,232 --> 00:56:01,359
If...

419
00:59:17,805 --> 00:59:21,559
Dr. Sartorius, I am Kelvin.

420
00:59:21,684 --> 00:59:23,352
I arrived two hours ago.

421
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:39,994
Listen, this is ridiculous.

422
00:59:43,831 --> 00:59:46,875
Either open up
or I'll break down the door.

423
00:59:47,084 --> 00:59:50,588
All right, I'll open the door,
but don't come in.

424
00:59:50,754 --> 00:59:53,132
I'll come out.
- Fine.

425
00:59:56,468 --> 00:59:58,345
My name is Kelvin.

426
00:59:59,597 --> 01:00:00,973
Go on.

427
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:03,142
You must have heard of me.

428
01:00:03,392 --> 01:00:06,478
I work, or worked, with Gibarian.

429
01:00:06,729 --> 01:00:07,771
Go on.

430
01:00:08,022 --> 01:00:12,026
Snaut told me about Gibarian.

431
01:00:13,235 --> 01:00:16,488
Then you already know the story.

432
01:00:16,488 --> 01:00:19,116
Yes, it's horrible.

433
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:23,162
I don't know the details,
but he's dead.

434
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:26,165
That's not the problem.
We all die.

435
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:31,003
But he insisted on being buried on Earth.
Is space really such a bad grave for him?

436
01:00:32,046 --> 01:00:34,757
But Gibarian wanted to be
in the ground, with the worms.

437
01:00:35,049 --> 01:00:37,635
I wanted to disregard it,
but Snaut insisted.

438
01:00:37,801 --> 01:00:41,055
- Have you ever heard of Burton?
- He was the pilot who...

439
01:00:41,055 --> 01:00:43,390
Yes, he was in the search party
for Fechner.

440
01:00:44,141 --> 01:00:47,311
Fechner died a magnificent death,
but Gibarian was a coward.

441
01:00:47,436 --> 01:00:51,065
There's no point
talking badly of him now.

442
01:00:51,774 --> 01:00:55,194
It's at least worth talking about duty.

443
01:00:55,277 --> 01:00:56,695
Duty to whom?

444
01:00:56,945 --> 01:00:59,073
- To truth.
- You mean to people.

445
01:00:59,073 --> 01:01:01,408
You won't find truth there. Look.

446
01:01:07,289 --> 01:01:11,960
Your position is absurd.
Your so-called courage is inhuman!

447
01:01:12,419 --> 01:01:14,088
You hear me?

448
01:01:20,302 --> 01:01:23,931
Go away.
You're too impressionable.

449
01:01:23,972 --> 01:01:27,226
You must get used to everything.
Good day.

450
01:04:31,368 --> 01:04:33,745
I spoke to Sartorius.

451
01:04:34,621 --> 01:04:36,790
He's a rotten person.

452
01:04:37,124 --> 01:04:39,001
He's a very talented scientist.

453
01:04:46,008 --> 01:04:49,636
I think I'm a little sick.

454
01:04:51,138 --> 01:04:55,392
There's nothing wrong with you.
You just won't take advice.

455
01:04:55,559 --> 01:04:59,813
Snaut, aside from the three of us,
is there anyone else on the station?

456
01:04:59,813 --> 01:05:01,398
Did you see someone?

457
01:05:03,942 --> 01:05:06,570
What were you warning me about?

458
01:05:07,446 --> 01:05:09,197
Whom did you see?

459
01:05:09,448 --> 01:05:12,826
Was it a human being?
Is she real?

460
01:05:14,202 --> 01:05:18,165
Can she be touched? Wounded?

461
01:05:19,708 --> 01:05:21,960
You saw her today.

462
01:05:24,463 --> 01:05:27,174
And you?
Who the hell are you?

463
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:34,598
Quiet.

464
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:49,488
- Where did she come from?
- Leave me alone.

465
01:05:52,616 --> 01:05:53,867
You're afraid.

466
01:05:58,747 --> 01:05:59,998
Don't worry.

467
01:06:02,626 --> 01:06:04,252
I won't think you're insane.

468
01:06:04,878 --> 01:06:09,508
Insane?
God, you know absolutely nothing!

469
01:06:09,716 --> 01:06:11,009
Insane...

470
01:06:12,469 --> 01:06:14,137
That would be a blessing.

471
01:06:21,770 --> 01:06:23,230
Listen, Snaut...

472
01:07:30,547 --> 01:07:31,548
It's all so senseless.

473
01:07:33,717 --> 01:07:38,055
They won't understand me.
They think I've gone crazy.

474
01:07:47,105 --> 01:07:48,982
Do you see, Kris,
how it's not entirely absurd?

475
01:07:49,483 --> 01:07:52,819
I have to do this because
I'm afraid they'll come in here.

476
01:07:52,944 --> 01:07:54,446
I mean Snaut and Sartorius.

477
01:07:54,488 --> 01:07:57,115
They themselves don't understand
what they're doing.

478
01:07:57,616 --> 01:07:59,743
I'm afraid, Kris...

479
01:08:00,994 --> 01:08:02,579
I can't...

480
01:08:03,955 --> 01:08:05,999
Nobody will be able to understand.

481
01:08:06,333 --> 01:08:09,711
Open up! You hear, Gibarian?
Open up!

482
01:08:09,878 --> 01:08:13,590
Don't be stupid.
It's just us – Snaut and Sartorius.

483
01:08:13,715 --> 01:08:15,884
We want to help you.

484
01:08:16,134 --> 01:08:18,512
They want to help me.

485
01:08:20,097 --> 01:08:22,349
Just a second. Quit knocking.

486
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:34,444
I am my own judge.

487
01:08:37,864 --> 01:08:39,866
Have you seen her?

488
01:08:40,992 --> 01:08:44,329
Kris, understand that
this is not madness.

489
01:08:47,749 --> 01:08:52,337
It has something to do
with conscience.

490
01:09:02,848 --> 01:09:07,394
I really wanted you
to get here in time, Kris.

491
01:13:52,887 --> 01:13:54,806
Where did you...?

492
01:13:59,561 --> 01:14:01,563
It's so nice.

493
01:14:14,701 --> 01:14:18,288
But... but it's not...

494
01:14:20,582 --> 01:14:23,168
How did you know where I...?

495
01:14:23,293 --> 01:14:25,670
What do you mean, "how"?

496
01:14:32,051 --> 01:14:34,971
Don't, Kris. That tickles.

497
01:14:46,608 --> 01:14:49,611
Where are my shoes?
- Shoes?

498
01:15:05,752 --> 01:15:08,588
No. They're not there.

499
01:15:20,391 --> 01:15:22,268
Who's this?

500
01:15:41,412 --> 01:15:42,997
Kris...

501
01:15:44,874 --> 01:15:46,543
it's me.

502
01:15:56,302 --> 01:15:58,054
You know...

503
01:16:01,307 --> 01:16:03,810
I have the feeling...

504
01:16:07,814 --> 01:16:10,066
as if I've forgotten something.

505
01:16:21,077 --> 01:16:23,204
I can't understand it.

506
01:16:27,917 --> 01:16:29,544
Do you love me?

507
01:16:29,586 --> 01:16:33,923
Don't be silly, Hari.
As if you didn't know.

508
01:16:34,424 --> 01:16:37,218
I'm going out for a moment.
Wait for me, okay?

509
01:16:37,343 --> 01:16:41,472
- I'll go with you.
- No, Hari. I'll be back soon.

510
01:16:43,224 --> 01:16:44,851
No.

511
01:16:44,976 --> 01:16:47,478
What's with you? Why?

512
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:54,110
I don't know. I can't.

513
01:16:54,193 --> 01:16:56,112
You can't what?

514
01:16:57,113 --> 01:17:01,618
It feels like I...
I have to see you... all the time.

515
01:17:03,703 --> 01:17:05,997
What are you, a child?

516
01:17:06,122 --> 01:17:09,000
I have work to do, Hari.

517
01:17:16,507 --> 01:17:19,135
I'm behaving foolishly.

518
01:17:21,137 --> 01:17:23,014
And so are you.

519
01:17:23,139 --> 01:17:27,268
Running around all disheveled,
like Snaut.

520
01:17:28,478 --> 01:17:31,230
- Like who?
- Like Snaut.

521
01:17:33,358 --> 01:17:36,152
Listen, how do you...

522
01:17:39,739 --> 01:17:43,117
Well, I have to go.
If you want, we can go together.

523
01:17:44,786 --> 01:17:48,164
But you won't be able to get
into a suit with your dress on.

524
01:17:48,414 --> 01:17:50,291
Get undressed.

525
01:17:54,003 --> 01:17:56,923
Kris, help me. I can't undo it.

526
01:18:43,469 --> 01:18:45,805
Why are you looking at me like that?

527
01:19:05,074 --> 01:19:14,542
SOLARIS
Part Two

528
01:20:24,153 --> 01:20:25,947
Get in.

529
01:20:26,572 --> 01:20:28,407
- What about you?
- I'm right behind you.

530
01:20:28,449 --> 01:20:30,785
I have to shut the hatch.

531
01:20:33,579 --> 01:20:36,457
Is everything all right?
Are you comfortable?

532
01:20:36,541 --> 01:20:38,835
Yes. Hurry, Kris.

533
01:22:44,502 --> 01:22:45,836
You could at least knock.

534
01:22:46,128 --> 01:22:49,006
It sounded
like you were talking to someone.

535
01:22:49,382 --> 01:22:51,217
All the more reason.

536
01:22:51,384 --> 01:22:53,386
So you had guests?

537
01:22:53,636 --> 01:22:56,847
Well, I see you took
good care of them.

538
01:22:58,849 --> 01:23:02,019
It's nothing.
You won't die from it.

539
01:23:02,895 --> 01:23:05,398
Did you at least start out modestly?

540
01:23:05,773 --> 01:23:09,402
Narcotics, poisons, barbiturates, eh?

541
01:23:10,152 --> 01:23:13,656
If you plan to clown around,
you might as well leave.

542
01:23:13,864 --> 01:23:16,909
Sometimes you become a clown
without wanting to.

543
01:23:17,284 --> 01:23:21,580
Don't tell me you haven't tried
a rope or a hammer.

544
01:23:22,081 --> 01:23:26,627
Did you happen to throw
the inkwell like Luther? No?

545
01:23:34,510 --> 01:23:35,261
So,

546
01:23:35,386 --> 01:23:38,889
one, two, and into the rocket,

547
01:23:39,348 --> 01:23:40,266
and that was that.

548
01:23:40,349 --> 01:23:41,851
Next time, don't panic.

549
01:23:43,644 --> 01:23:49,650
And push the button from the corridor.
You could get burned.

550
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:53,404
- What was that?
- I don't know.

551
01:23:53,904 --> 01:23:58,492
Then again, we've managed
to determine a few things.

552
01:23:59,785 --> 01:24:01,245
Who was it?

553
01:24:01,787 --> 01:24:04,790
She died 10 years ago.

554
01:24:06,167 --> 01:24:10,296
What you saw was the materialization
of your conception of her.

555
01:24:11,422 --> 01:24:13,758
What was her name?
- Hari.

556
01:24:23,017 --> 01:24:28,397
Everything began after we started
experimenting with radiation.

557
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:31,067
We hit the Ocean's surface

558
01:24:31,567 --> 01:24:36,322
with strong X-ray beams.

559
01:24:37,656 --> 01:24:38,574
But it...

560
01:24:38,574 --> 01:24:43,037
Incidentally, consider yourself lucky.
After all, she's a part of your past.

561
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:47,833
What if it had been something
you had never seen before,

562
01:24:48,084 --> 01:24:50,086
but something you had thought
or imagined?

563
01:24:51,337 --> 01:24:53,047
I don't understand.

564
01:24:53,214 --> 01:24:56,717
Evidently the Ocean responded to
our heavy radiation with something else.

565
01:24:56,717 --> 01:25:01,806
It probed our minds and extracted
something like islands of memory.

566
01:25:06,852 --> 01:25:08,312
Will she come back?

567
01:25:08,479 --> 01:25:09,480
She will...

568
01:25:10,314 --> 01:25:11,732
and she won't.

569
01:25:16,112 --> 01:25:19,323
- Hari the Second.
- There may be an endless number of them.

570
01:25:19,323 --> 01:25:21,325
Why didn't you warn me?

571
01:25:21,617 --> 01:25:23,494
You wouldn't have believed me.

572
01:25:23,869 --> 01:25:28,624
I got scared and acted not entirely...

573
01:25:28,624 --> 01:25:32,086
Don't be hard on yourself.
We've had enough of Gibarian.

574
01:25:32,878 --> 01:25:35,631
There's talk about
liquidating the station.

575
01:25:36,257 --> 01:25:38,759
That's why I was sent here.

576
01:25:40,386 --> 01:25:44,265
If I submit a report, will you sign it?

577
01:25:44,765 --> 01:25:47,768
And what if we suddenly make
that long-awaited contact?

578
01:25:48,644 --> 01:25:54,775
Night is the best time here.
It somehow reminds me of Earth.

579
01:25:55,234 --> 01:25:58,988
Attach strips of paper
to the air vents.

580
01:26:01,282 --> 01:26:06,537
At night it sounds like
the rustling of leaves.

581
01:26:07,413 --> 01:26:11,000
It was Gibarian's invention.
So simple, like all genius.

582
01:26:11,041 --> 01:26:12,293
I adopted it right away.

583
01:26:13,043 --> 01:26:17,173
Sartorius made fun of us,
but he has one in his room.

584
01:26:17,923 --> 01:26:20,384
He hides it in the closet.

585
01:26:22,303 --> 01:26:24,305
You should rest.

586
01:26:24,763 --> 01:26:27,766
If you can, come to the library later.

587
01:26:28,392 --> 01:26:31,562
I've prepared a list of books for you.

588
01:28:21,338 --> 01:28:23,966
Snaut, is that you?

589
01:28:30,848 --> 01:28:35,311
Kris, where are you?

590
01:28:36,437 --> 01:28:37,938
Come here.

591
01:30:14,827 --> 01:30:18,664
- It's so dark.
- Come here. Don't be afraid.

592
01:31:15,012 --> 01:31:16,263
Hari!

593
01:31:16,472 --> 01:31:19,016
The door opens the other way.

594
01:31:35,782 --> 01:31:37,868
Kris.

595
01:32:05,187 --> 01:32:08,398
Hari ! Hari!

596
01:32:16,281 --> 01:32:18,450
Hang on.
I'll be right back.

597
01:33:08,208 --> 01:33:11,461
When I saw you weren't there,
I got scared.

598
01:33:15,007 --> 01:33:16,758
Hello, Kris.

599
01:33:16,883 --> 01:33:18,010
Yeah.

600
01:33:18,260 --> 01:33:20,762
I can barely hear you.
Speak louder.

601
01:33:22,097 --> 01:33:23,849
What are you doing right now?

602
01:33:25,517 --> 01:33:27,269
Nothing.

603
01:33:27,644 --> 01:33:31,773
Sartorius has invited us
to his laboratory.

604
01:33:32,524 --> 01:33:33,525
How are you?

605
01:33:34,026 --> 01:33:36,653
Fine. I'll try to make it.

606
01:33:50,917 --> 01:33:53,045
Kris, what's wrong with me?

607
01:34:09,436 --> 01:34:12,773
Maybe it's epilepsy?

608
01:35:07,369 --> 01:35:08,370
This is my wife.

609
01:35:11,498 --> 01:35:12,582
Hello.

610
01:35:15,711 --> 01:35:17,504
Hello.

611
01:35:20,590 --> 01:35:23,593
- We've been waiting for you.
- I was busy.

612
01:35:25,137 --> 01:35:29,099
- How lovely! Are these yours?
- No, they're Snaut's.

613
01:35:30,392 --> 01:35:36,523
So, as far as I can tell,
they are constructed...

614
01:35:36,523 --> 01:35:38,358
Let's just call them "guests."

615
01:35:38,650 --> 01:35:39,526
Fine.

616
01:35:40,861 --> 01:35:45,490
While our structure is made of atoms,
theirs consists of neutrinos.

617
01:35:45,866 --> 01:35:50,036
But neutrino systems are unstable.

618
01:35:50,495 --> 01:35:53,665
They seem to be stabilized
by Solaris' force field.

619
01:35:59,129 --> 01:36:01,256
You've got a superb specimen.

620
01:36:03,175 --> 01:36:04,634
That's my wife.

621
01:36:05,761 --> 01:36:08,638
Wonderful. Perfect.

622
01:36:11,850 --> 01:36:15,020
Then take a blood sample
from your wife.

623
01:36:15,103 --> 01:36:16,271
Why?

624
01:36:17,105 --> 01:36:18,899
It'll sober you up a bit.

625
01:36:54,810 --> 01:36:57,145
What do you think?

626
01:36:59,022 --> 01:37:00,899
- Snaut?
- Enough of all of you!

627
01:37:03,652 --> 01:37:06,571
I burned the blood with acid,
but it's restoring itself.

628
01:37:06,822 --> 01:37:07,948
Regeneration?

629
01:37:08,198 --> 01:37:13,286
In essence, immortality –
Faust's problem.

630
01:37:13,662 --> 01:37:14,579
Excuse me.

631
01:37:19,668 --> 01:37:21,419
There's no need for cotton.

632
01:37:22,671 --> 01:37:25,799
Are you qualified
to perform an autopsy?

633
01:37:26,216 --> 01:37:28,844
I've already told you – she's my wife.
Don't you understand?

634
01:37:29,427 --> 01:37:32,597
I think these experiments are
more humane than testing on rabbits.

635
01:37:33,723 --> 01:37:34,933
Don't you agree?

636
01:37:35,350 --> 01:37:36,852
It doesn't matter.

637
01:37:37,227 --> 01:37:39,604
It would be like
cutting my own leg off.

638
01:37:41,064 --> 01:37:43,066
Did you feel pain
when you broke through the door?

639
01:37:43,733 --> 01:37:45,861
Pain? Of course.

640
01:37:46,444 --> 01:37:49,948
So if I ever catch you doing anything...

641
01:37:49,948 --> 01:37:51,992
- You're lucky.
- How so?

642
01:37:53,243 --> 01:37:54,995
It's meaningless,

643
01:37:55,078 --> 01:37:57,622
yet you've managed to establish
emotional contact with them.

644
01:37:58,248 --> 01:38:00,959
It may be pleasant...
- What are you, jealous?

645
01:38:01,710 --> 01:38:03,086
Maybe I'm jealous.

646
01:38:03,378 --> 01:38:06,006
No, you're not jealous.
After all, you're not guilty of anything.

647
01:38:06,006 --> 01:38:08,008
- Of course.
- But I am guilty.

648
01:38:08,091 --> 01:38:09,384
Of what?

649
01:38:10,010 --> 01:38:13,889
When you turn into an utter cripple
with no arms or legs, call us.

650
01:38:14,639 --> 01:38:17,517
We'll empty your chamber pot.

651
01:38:18,226 --> 01:38:21,479
- But whom have you wronged?
- You, among others.

652
01:39:07,943 --> 01:39:11,571
My father shot that.
Well, I shot a bit.

653
01:42:06,871 --> 01:42:07,872
Listen...

654
01:42:26,266 --> 01:42:27,892
I don't know myself at all.

655
01:42:30,145 --> 01:42:30,979
I don't remember.

656
01:42:33,148 --> 01:42:37,026
When I close my eyes,
I can't recall my face. And you?

657
01:42:38,153 --> 01:42:38,736
What?

658
01:42:41,030 --> 01:42:44,284
- Do you know yourself?
- Like all humans.

659
01:42:55,003 --> 01:42:59,007
That woman in the white coat hated me.

660
01:42:59,174 --> 01:43:03,303
Don't make things up.
She died before you and I met.

661
01:43:05,680 --> 01:43:08,141
I don't understand
why you're deceiving me.

662
01:43:09,309 --> 01:43:10,810
I remember perfectly.

663
01:43:11,686 --> 01:43:15,648
We drank tea and she kicked me out.

664
01:43:16,691 --> 01:43:19,444
Naturally, I stood up and left.
I remember perfectly.

665
01:43:21,571 --> 01:43:23,031
What happened after that?

666
01:43:25,074 --> 01:43:27,035
After that, I went away,

667
01:43:27,952 --> 01:43:30,205
and we never saw each other again.

668
01:43:31,331 --> 01:43:32,332
Where did you go?

669
01:43:33,082 --> 01:43:34,584
To a different city.

670
01:43:35,919 --> 01:43:37,837
- Why?
- I was transferred.

671
01:43:39,297 --> 01:43:40,924
Why did you leave without me?

672
01:43:43,801 --> 01:43:45,553
You didn't want to come.

673
01:43:48,598 --> 01:43:50,225
That I remember.

674
01:44:48,658 --> 01:44:52,912
Forgive me.
I thought you were already awake.

675
01:44:53,037 --> 01:44:54,038
What happened?

676
01:44:54,664 --> 01:44:56,624
The regeneration is slowing down.

677
01:44:57,166 --> 01:45:00,753
For two or three hours
we can be free of them.

678
01:45:01,170 --> 01:45:03,298
You came in the middle of the night
to tell me that?

679
01:45:04,924 --> 01:45:08,511
I'll tell you why I came.

680
01:45:09,137 --> 01:45:11,556
Sartorius and I were thinking:

681
01:45:12,265 --> 01:45:16,519
If the Ocean derives guests from us
while we dream,

682
01:45:16,936 --> 01:45:20,440
maybe it makes sense to transmit
our waking thoughts to it.

683
01:45:20,440 --> 01:45:23,443
- How?
- With beams of radiation.

684
01:45:24,444 --> 01:45:28,072
Perhaps it will understand
and spare us from all these apparitions.

685
01:45:28,531 --> 01:45:32,160
Again these ridiculous X-ray sermons
about the greatness of science?

686
01:45:32,327 --> 01:45:36,289
We'll modulate the beam
with the brain waves of one of us.

687
01:45:36,456 --> 01:45:38,333
And "one of us" means me, of course.

688
01:45:39,959 --> 01:45:43,588
An encephalogram!
A transcription of all my thoughts!

689
01:45:43,963 --> 01:45:47,091
What if I suddenly want her to die?
To disappear!

690
01:45:48,676 --> 01:45:51,554
Entrust everything to that...
that mass of jelly?

691
01:45:52,180 --> 01:45:54,682
It's already invaded my soul.

692
01:45:55,183 --> 01:45:57,101
Kris, we're running out of time.

693
01:45:58,061 --> 01:46:02,357
Sartorius has proposed
another project: the annihilator.

694
01:46:03,107 --> 01:46:06,486
Self-destruction
of the neutrino systems.

695
01:46:08,571 --> 01:46:11,366
What is this? Blackmail?

696
01:46:11,741 --> 01:46:15,078
I convinced him to start
with the encephalogram.

697
01:46:15,495 --> 01:46:19,332
But forget about this for now.

698
01:46:21,125 --> 01:46:24,879
Tomorrow's my birthday.
Consider yourself invited.

699
01:46:25,254 --> 01:46:28,091
- Liar! You just want to make up with us.
- Yes, I do.

700
01:46:28,132 --> 01:46:30,134
Don't shout. She sleeping.

701
01:46:34,263 --> 01:46:34,889
Sleeping?

702
01:46:36,891 --> 01:46:39,268
She's already learned how to sleep?

703
01:46:40,728 --> 01:46:42,897
This will all end badly.

704
01:46:43,648 --> 01:46:46,275
- Well, what do you propose I do?
- Nothing.

705
01:46:46,859 --> 01:46:49,487
So you'll come?
Tomorrow, in the library.

706
01:46:53,783 --> 01:46:55,618
We'll set the table.

707
01:46:57,036 --> 01:47:01,290
At least there are no windows in there.

708
01:47:02,041 --> 01:47:03,626
In the meantime, let's go.

709
01:47:04,752 --> 01:47:06,546
Sartorius is waiting.

710
01:47:09,674 --> 01:47:11,175
She's sleeping.

711
01:47:11,801 --> 01:47:13,386
Will she follow me?

712
01:47:14,762 --> 01:47:16,806
Don't lock the door.

713
01:47:20,309 --> 01:47:21,769
What door?

714
01:47:23,062 --> 01:47:24,439
It's just an apparition.

715
01:48:20,369 --> 01:48:21,329
Wait. I'll be right back.

716
01:48:23,498 --> 01:48:24,874
Where are you going?

717
01:49:00,409 --> 01:49:03,412
Forgive me.

718
01:49:59,719 --> 01:50:01,721
Why aren't you asleep?

719
01:50:05,975 --> 01:50:08,978
- You don't love me.
- Stop it, Hari.

720
01:50:11,731 --> 01:50:14,108
- We have to talk.
- About what?

721
01:50:16,110 --> 01:50:21,866
You understand that I don't know
where I came from.

722
01:50:23,242 --> 01:50:25,620
Maybe you know?
- What's with you?

723
01:50:25,828 --> 01:50:27,830
Stop. Don't interrupt.

724
01:50:29,498 --> 01:50:30,958
If you know,

725
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:35,963
but you can't tell me now,

726
01:50:36,505 --> 01:50:39,634
perhaps one day you will.

727
01:50:40,259 --> 01:50:41,886
What are you talking about?

728
01:50:42,219 --> 01:50:45,222
I don't understand a thing, honestly.

729
01:50:46,265 --> 01:50:48,851
You don't want to tell me.

730
01:50:49,727 --> 01:50:51,354
You're afraid.

731
01:50:52,980 --> 01:50:54,774
Then I'll tell you.

732
01:50:57,276 --> 01:50:58,486
I'm not Hari.

733
01:50:59,987 --> 01:51:01,238
Hari is dead.

734
01:51:03,157 --> 01:51:04,659
She poisoned herself.

735
01:51:06,535 --> 01:51:09,121
I'm somebody else.

736
01:51:09,372 --> 01:51:11,666
Who told you this?

737
01:51:12,249 --> 01:51:14,919
- Sartorius just told me.
- Last night.

738
01:51:19,423 --> 01:51:21,926
It would have been better
if you had told me yourself.

739
01:51:22,176 --> 01:51:24,762
My God, what's the difference?

740
01:51:30,768 --> 01:51:32,895
How have you lived all this time?

741
01:51:34,313 --> 01:51:36,023
Were you in love with anyone?

742
01:51:36,524 --> 01:51:37,900
I don't know.

743
01:51:38,067 --> 01:51:39,944
Did you ever think of me?

744
01:51:40,277 --> 01:51:42,571
Yes, but not all the time.

745
01:51:45,533 --> 01:51:47,326
Only when I felt unhappy.

746
01:51:54,041 --> 01:51:58,587
You know, it feels like
somebody is tricking us.

747
01:52:00,715 --> 01:52:05,970
And the longer this fog lasts,
the worse it will be for you in the end.

748
01:52:05,970 --> 01:52:07,722
Particularly for you, Kris.

749
01:52:09,974 --> 01:52:11,600
How can I help you?

750
01:52:14,353 --> 01:52:15,354
Tell me.

751
01:52:15,938 --> 01:52:21,360
And her, the other one,
what happened to her?

752
01:52:30,494 --> 01:52:32,121
We argued.

753
01:52:33,247 --> 01:52:36,250
Towards the end, we argued a lot.

754
01:52:36,459 --> 01:52:39,253
I gathered my things and left.

755
01:52:40,963 --> 01:52:44,258
She made me understand
without saying it directly,

756
01:52:45,009 --> 01:52:49,013
but when you live with someone for a
long time, such things aren't necessary.

757
01:52:51,015 --> 01:52:52,892
I was sure they were just words,

758
01:52:53,100 --> 01:52:55,770
but then I remembered that I'd left

759
01:52:58,147 --> 01:53:00,483
the laboratory specimens
in the refrigerator.

760
01:53:02,485 --> 01:53:07,907
I had brought them from the laboratory
and explained how they worked.

761
01:53:08,991 --> 01:53:10,159
I got scared.

762
01:53:11,410 --> 01:53:13,162
I wanted to go to her.

763
01:53:13,287 --> 01:53:15,331
But then I thought it would look like
I had taken her words seriously.

764
01:53:15,581 --> 01:53:18,334
After three days, I couldn't take it
anymore and I went to see her.

765
01:53:18,959 --> 01:53:21,712
When I got there,
she was already dead.

766
01:53:22,713 --> 01:53:24,673
There was a needle mark on her arm.

767
01:53:27,968 --> 01:53:29,428
Like this?

768
01:53:38,604 --> 01:53:41,106
Why did she do it?

769
01:53:42,358 --> 01:53:46,612
She probably sensed
that I didn't really love her.

770
01:53:50,741 --> 01:53:52,201
But now I do.

771
01:54:04,755 --> 01:54:06,841
- Kris.
- What?

772
01:54:07,758 --> 01:54:09,134
I love you.

773
01:54:14,974 --> 01:54:17,142
Get some sleep.

774
01:54:17,268 --> 01:54:18,894
I don't know how to sleep.

775
01:54:21,272 --> 01:54:26,277
It's not sleep.
It's somehow around me.

776
01:54:29,029 --> 01:54:33,284
It's as if it weren't just inside of me,
but much farther away.

777
01:54:34,535 --> 01:54:38,247
It's probably still sleep.

778
01:55:19,204 --> 01:55:22,666
So, it looks like our guest of honor
isn't showing up.

779
01:55:26,837 --> 01:55:29,673
- Why?
- Maybe he has guests.

780
01:56:26,021 --> 01:56:28,524
Oh, everyone's already here?

781
01:56:32,236 --> 01:56:34,863
You're an hour and a half late.

782
01:56:42,121 --> 01:56:44,665
What's that you're reading?

783
01:56:50,129 --> 01:56:52,047
It's all rubbish.

784
01:56:54,425 --> 01:56:56,176
Rubbish.

785
01:56:58,053 --> 01:57:03,434
Where the hell is...

786
01:57:05,686 --> 01:57:06,687
Here!

787
01:57:10,941 --> 01:57:13,694
"They come at night.

788
01:57:15,571 --> 01:57:18,282
But one must sleep sometime."

789
01:57:19,950 --> 01:57:21,577
That's the problem.

790
01:57:23,203 --> 01:57:27,791
Mankind has lost the ability to sleep.

791
01:57:33,172 --> 01:57:38,177
You'd better read.
I'm a little excited.

792
01:57:40,596 --> 01:57:44,099
"I know only one thing, señor.
When I...

793
01:57:55,194 --> 01:57:59,490
When I sleep, I know no fear,
no hope, no trouble, no bliss.

794
01:57:59,615 --> 01:58:01,825
Blessings on him who invented sleep.

795
01:58:04,244 --> 01:58:07,831
The common coin
that purchases all things,

796
01:58:07,873 --> 01:58:09,833
the balance that levels
shepherd and king,

797
01:58:10,334 --> 01:58:11,752
fool and wise man.

798
01:58:12,252 --> 01:58:14,505
There is only one bad thing
about sound sleep.

799
01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:17,508
They say it closely resembles death."

800
01:58:18,008 --> 01:58:22,471
"Never before, Sancho, have I heard you
speak so elegantly as now."

801
01:58:25,766 --> 01:58:30,771
That's great, but perhaps
you'll let me say something now?

802
01:58:32,022 --> 01:58:34,858
I propose a toast to Snaut,

803
01:58:35,400 --> 01:58:40,280
to his bravery,
to his devotion to duty.

804
01:58:40,364 --> 01:58:42,658
To science and to Snaut.

805
01:58:43,367 --> 01:58:46,537
Science? Nonsense.

806
01:58:47,913 --> 01:58:53,794
In this situation, mediocrity and genius
are equally useless.

807
01:58:54,920 --> 01:59:00,175
We have no interest
in conquering any cosmos.

808
01:59:01,260 --> 01:59:04,763
We want to extend the Earth
to the borders of the cosmos.

809
01:59:05,931 --> 01:59:08,058
We don't know what to do
with other worlds.

810
01:59:08,559 --> 01:59:10,310
We don't need other worlds.

811
01:59:11,436 --> 01:59:14,022
We need a mirror.

812
01:59:14,565 --> 01:59:18,569
We struggle for contact,
but we'll never find it.

813
01:59:19,027 --> 01:59:21,572
We're in the foolish human
predicament

814
01:59:21,697 --> 01:59:25,200
of striving for a goal that he fears,

815
01:59:25,784 --> 01:59:27,953
that he has no need for.

816
01:59:28,704 --> 01:59:32,708
Man needs man.

817
01:59:40,424 --> 01:59:42,342
Let's drink to Gibarian.

818
01:59:42,968 --> 01:59:44,595
To his memory.

819
01:59:45,053 --> 01:59:47,848
Even though he got frightened.

820
02:00:00,944 --> 02:00:03,947
No, Gibarian was not frightened.

821
02:00:06,950 --> 02:00:09,244
There are worse things.

822
02:00:11,997 --> 02:00:14,958
He died of hopelessness.

823
02:00:17,127 --> 02:00:21,131
He thought all this
was happening only to him.

824
02:00:21,256 --> 02:00:23,258
My God!

825
02:00:23,508 --> 02:00:25,636
All these heartbreaking lamentations

826
02:00:25,719 --> 02:00:27,763
are nothing but
second-rate Dostoyevsky.

827
02:00:28,513 --> 02:00:30,265
Who are you to judge?

828
02:00:30,515 --> 02:00:32,893
I know why I'm here.
I'm working.

829
02:00:34,269 --> 02:00:36,772
Man was created by nature
so he could learn her ways.

830
02:00:38,857 --> 02:00:42,527
In his endless search for the truth,
man is condemned to knowledge.

831
02:00:43,028 --> 02:00:44,404
Everything else is whim.

832
02:00:46,907 --> 02:00:49,034
Permit me to ask,
my esteemed colleague:

833
02:00:49,368 --> 02:00:51,787
Why have you come to Solaris?

834
02:00:52,913 --> 02:00:55,749
- What do you mean, why?
- Well, are you working a lot?

835
02:00:56,792 --> 02:00:59,127
Forgive me, but aside from
the romance with your ex-wife,

836
02:00:59,378 --> 02:01:01,755
nothing seems to interest you.

837
02:01:02,297 --> 02:01:05,884
You spend all day lounging in
a bed of noble thoughts,

838
02:01:05,926 --> 02:01:08,762
and that's how
you carry out your duty.

839
02:01:08,929 --> 02:01:11,431
You've lost touch with reality.

840
02:01:11,765 --> 02:01:13,684
Forgive me, but you're simply a loafer.

841
02:01:14,017 --> 02:01:15,310
Enough!

842
02:01:16,019 --> 02:01:19,523
Let's try to be pleasant.
We'll drink to Gibarian.

843
02:01:19,648 --> 02:01:21,400
Not to Gibarian, but to Man.

844
02:01:21,692 --> 02:01:23,902
Are you saying
Gibarian was not a man?

845
02:01:23,944 --> 02:01:27,322
Stop it, Kris.
Let's not fight.

846
02:01:27,698 --> 02:01:32,327
After all, it's my birthday.
It's my day.

847
02:01:32,661 --> 02:01:34,288
Of course.

848
02:01:34,955 --> 02:01:38,667
I think that Kris Kelvin

849
02:01:39,710 --> 02:01:42,170
is more consistent than both of you.

850
02:01:42,921 --> 02:01:47,467
In inhuman conditions,
he has behaved humanely.

851
02:01:47,968 --> 02:01:50,595
And you act
as if none of this concerns you,

852
02:01:52,681 --> 02:01:54,599
and consider your guests –
it seems that's what you call us –

853
02:01:54,683 --> 02:01:57,227
something external, a hindrance.

854
02:01:57,978 --> 02:02:01,857
But it's a part of you.
It's your conscience.

855
02:02:05,819 --> 02:02:07,821
And Kris loves me.

856
02:02:11,450 --> 02:02:14,745
Maybe it's not me he loves,

857
02:02:15,454 --> 02:02:18,707
but he's simply protecting himself.

858
02:02:19,875 --> 02:02:22,002
He wants me alive.

859
02:02:23,253 --> 02:02:25,505
That's not the point.
It doesn't matter why man loves.

860
02:02:25,505 --> 02:02:26,965
It's different for everyone.

861
02:02:28,342 --> 02:02:32,507
It's not Kris.
It's you.

862
02:02:33,472 --> 02:02:36,350
I hate you all.
- I would ask you...

863
02:02:36,350 --> 02:02:39,770
Please don't interrupt me.
I'm a woman, after all.

864
02:02:39,895 --> 02:02:42,105
You're not a woman
and you're not a human being.

865
02:02:42,105 --> 02:02:43,982
Understand that,

866
02:02:43,982 --> 02:02:47,110
if you're capable
of understanding anything.

867
02:02:49,279 --> 02:02:52,282
There is no Hari. She's dead.

868
02:02:55,619 --> 02:02:58,997
You're just a reproduction,

869
02:02:59,623 --> 02:03:02,125
a mechanical reproduction.

870
02:03:02,292 --> 02:03:04,669
A copy. A matrix.

871
02:03:13,929 --> 02:03:14,805
Yes.

872
02:03:17,891 --> 02:03:19,393
Maybe.

873
02:03:28,693 --> 02:03:29,820
But I...

874
02:03:31,029 --> 02:03:34,324
I am becoming a human being.

875
02:03:38,328 --> 02:03:40,789
I can feel just as deeply as you.

876
02:03:42,582 --> 02:03:43,917
Believe me.

877
02:03:47,087 --> 02:03:49,089
I can already get by without him.

878
02:03:51,675 --> 02:03:52,968
I...

879
02:03:56,096 --> 02:03:57,347
love him.

880
02:04:00,434 --> 02:04:02,185
I am a human being.

881
02:04:03,311 --> 02:04:04,688
You...

882
02:04:06,231 --> 02:04:07,983
you're very cruel.

883
02:05:03,413 --> 02:05:05,999
Get up! Get up right now!

884
02:05:14,174 --> 02:05:15,884
My dear man.

885
02:05:21,681 --> 02:05:23,892
Nothing could be easier.

886
02:05:28,313 --> 02:05:30,440
We've wasted time arguing.

887
02:05:31,816 --> 02:05:36,279
We're losing our dignity
and human character.

888
02:05:37,197 --> 02:05:38,073
No.

889
02:05:39,282 --> 02:05:43,453
You're human, each in your own way.

890
02:05:44,663 --> 02:05:46,414
That's why you argue.

891
02:05:48,583 --> 02:05:50,085
I hope I'm not bothering you.

892
02:05:54,589 --> 02:05:56,424
You're a good man...

893
02:05:57,592 --> 02:06:00,220
but you look awful.

894
02:06:08,228 --> 02:06:10,188
I've really lost heart.

895
02:06:12,107 --> 02:06:14,568
Help me out a bit.

896
02:06:18,989 --> 02:06:24,119
Doesn't a man
who's ready to give up his life

897
02:06:24,244 --> 02:06:28,957
just to make cursed contact

898
02:06:29,249 --> 02:06:32,502
in order to know more about it
have the right to get drunk?

899
02:06:32,752 --> 02:06:36,381
He has every right.

900
02:06:38,008 --> 02:06:41,761
Do you believe in our mission, Kelvin?

901
02:06:43,471 --> 02:06:45,640
I'm not going to bed yet.

902
02:06:45,640 --> 02:06:47,851
It's important not to fall asleep.

903
02:06:48,643 --> 02:06:51,146
I'm going to see Faust.

904
02:06:52,522 --> 02:06:56,401
In the laboratory, our Faust –
Sartorius –

905
02:06:56,484 --> 02:06:59,404
is seeking a remedy for immortality.

906
02:06:59,529 --> 02:07:00,530
While we...

907
02:07:14,669 --> 02:07:19,883
Listen, let's open these hatches
and shout down below.

908
02:07:20,508 --> 02:07:22,552
It would suddenly hear.

909
02:07:23,178 --> 02:07:26,890
But what should we call it?

910
02:07:28,642 --> 02:07:33,647
Maybe we should whip it.

911
02:07:34,522 --> 02:07:37,192
Or, better yet, pray to it.

912
02:07:37,442 --> 02:07:38,568
What's wrong?

913
02:07:38,568 --> 02:07:41,446
I think I shut the door to the library.
She's there alone.

914
02:07:41,571 --> 02:07:43,573
Go. I feel better already.

915
02:07:43,948 --> 02:07:46,076
The station is changing its orbit.

916
02:07:46,910 --> 02:07:52,290
At 5 a.m. there will be
30 seconds of weightlessness.

917
02:07:53,166 --> 02:07:55,085
Don't forget.

918
02:11:07,861 --> 02:11:09,404
Hari.

919
02:11:14,617 --> 02:11:15,910
Hari.

920
02:11:17,787 --> 02:11:20,623
Forgive me, my darling.
I was lost in thought.

921
02:11:23,042 --> 02:11:24,752
Is something wrong?

922
02:11:26,170 --> 02:11:27,505
No, nothing.

923
02:11:28,423 --> 02:11:31,551
Everything's fine.

924
02:15:25,159 --> 02:15:27,036
She drank liquid oxygen.

925
02:15:29,413 --> 02:15:31,040
She did it out of despair.

926
02:15:32,291 --> 02:15:34,043
It'll get worse.

927
02:15:34,377 --> 02:15:37,672
The more she's with you,
the more human she'll become.

928
02:15:38,506 --> 02:15:41,634
Learn from Sartorius' example.
- Thanks for the advice.

929
02:15:46,681 --> 02:15:48,641
What do you intend to do?

930
02:15:49,142 --> 02:15:52,019
Wait until she returns.

931
02:15:52,270 --> 02:15:55,189
And then what?
Leave the station?

932
02:15:59,527 --> 02:16:04,532
Kris, she can only live here,
on the station. You know that.

933
02:16:06,576 --> 02:16:08,286
What can I do?

934
02:16:09,704 --> 02:16:12,039
I love her.
- Which one?

935
02:16:12,582 --> 02:16:16,961
Her, or the one in the rocket?
You can pull her in from space.

936
02:16:16,961 --> 02:16:18,963
She will appear again
and she'll keep appearing.

937
02:16:20,089 --> 02:16:23,801
Don't turn a scientific problem
into a common love story.

938
02:16:27,680 --> 02:16:30,433
I had a feeling this would end badly.

939
02:16:35,188 --> 02:16:37,481
You should help her.

940
02:16:53,831 --> 02:16:56,000
What a ghastly sight.

941
02:16:57,501 --> 02:17:00,463
I can never get used
to all these resurrections.

942
02:17:01,130 --> 02:17:02,632
Is it me?

943
02:18:55,453 --> 02:18:56,954
Hari...

944
02:19:01,834 --> 02:19:03,252
What?

945
02:19:03,878 --> 02:19:05,254
Why?

946
02:19:06,839 --> 02:19:08,090
Why?

947
02:19:09,884 --> 02:19:10,843
Why?

948
02:19:11,469 --> 02:19:12,636
Why?

949
02:19:14,847 --> 02:19:16,349
Why?

950
02:19:19,393 --> 02:19:22,521
No, it's not me.

951
02:19:27,026 --> 02:19:30,279
It's... I'm... not Hari...

952
02:19:31,238 --> 02:19:34,408
And you... Maybe you...

953
02:19:34,742 --> 02:19:38,037
- Don't, Hari.
- I'm not Hari!

954
02:19:40,164 --> 02:19:42,166
Fine!

955
02:19:42,500 --> 02:19:45,169
Maybe your appearance
is supposed to be torture.

956
02:19:45,294 --> 02:19:46,921
Maybe it's a favor from the Ocean.

957
02:19:47,046 --> 02:19:51,801
What does it matter
when you're worth more to me

958
02:19:52,176 --> 02:19:54,553
than any science could ever be?

959
02:19:55,429 --> 02:19:57,139
Do I look a lot like her?

960
02:19:57,306 --> 02:19:59,892
No, you looked like her.

961
02:20:00,518 --> 02:20:03,813
But now you – and not her –
are the real Hari.

962
02:20:04,146 --> 02:20:05,314
Tell me...

963
02:20:05,815 --> 02:20:06,941
Tell me...

964
02:20:07,566 --> 02:20:11,695
Do I disgust you? I'm so...

965
02:20:16,450 --> 02:20:19,537
I disgust you!
- No, Hari. That's not true.

966
02:20:19,662 --> 02:20:21,455
- You're lying!
- It's not true. Stop it.

967
02:20:21,539 --> 02:20:24,083
- I must be disgusting!
- Stop it.

968
02:20:28,838 --> 02:20:31,048
No.

969
02:20:31,465 --> 02:20:33,676
Don't touch me!

970
02:21:22,600 --> 02:21:24,477
I love you.

971
02:21:26,395 --> 02:21:30,649
What's the matter?

972
02:21:34,987 --> 02:21:37,990
Nothing.

973
02:21:44,371 --> 02:21:46,874
I'm not going back to Earth.

974
02:21:47,541 --> 02:21:51,170
I'll live here with you on the station.

975
02:21:52,546 --> 02:21:53,797
You know...

976
02:21:58,052 --> 02:22:01,055
I'm afraid.

977
02:24:08,682 --> 02:24:11,393
It looks like it's showing
some activity.

978
02:24:11,560 --> 02:24:13,896
Your encephalogram helped.

979
02:24:15,439 --> 02:24:17,066
You know...

980
02:24:17,316 --> 02:24:21,945
whenever we show pity,
we ravage ourselves.

981
02:24:22,571 --> 02:24:23,947
Maybe it's true...

982
02:24:24,948 --> 02:24:29,912
Suffering makes life seem

983
02:24:30,162 --> 02:24:32,456
dismal and suspect.

984
02:24:36,168 --> 02:24:37,836
But I won't accept that.

985
02:24:42,341 --> 02:24:44,301
No, I won't accept that.

986
02:24:49,473 --> 02:24:54,853
Is that which is indispensable to life
also harmful to it?

987
02:24:55,187 --> 02:25:01,485
No, it's not harmful.
Of course it's not harmful.

988
02:25:02,611 --> 02:25:04,738
Remember Tolstoy?

989
02:25:05,614 --> 02:25:09,993
His suffering over the impossibility
of loving mankind as a whole?

990
02:25:13,706 --> 02:25:16,208
How much time has passed since then?

991
02:25:16,959 --> 02:25:21,088
Somehow I can't figure it out.
Help me.

992
02:25:23,757 --> 02:25:25,634
See, I love you.

993
02:25:25,968 --> 02:25:30,139
But love is a feeling
we can experience

994
02:25:30,264 --> 02:25:32,516
but never explain.

995
02:25:33,016 --> 02:25:35,018
One can explain the concept.

996
02:25:35,144 --> 02:25:38,147
You love that which you can lose:

997
02:25:38,397 --> 02:25:41,984
Yourself, a woman, a homeland.

998
02:25:42,776 --> 02:25:47,906
Until today, love was simply
unattainable to mankind, to the Earth.

999
02:25:47,906 --> 02:25:49,908
Do you understand me, Snaut?

1000
02:25:50,033 --> 02:25:54,371
There are so few of us.
A few billion altogether. A handful!

1001
02:25:55,789 --> 02:26:01,170
Maybe we're here in order
to experience people

1002
02:26:01,420 --> 02:26:03,797
as a reason for love.

1003
02:26:08,177 --> 02:26:10,053
He seems to have a fever.

1004
02:26:11,680 --> 02:26:16,393
How did Gibarian die?
You still haven't told me.

1005
02:26:17,060 --> 02:26:19,938
I'll tell you. Later.

1006
02:26:20,564 --> 02:26:24,568
Gibarian didn't die of fear.
He died of shame.

1007
02:26:24,693 --> 02:26:29,573
Shame – the feeling
that will save mankind.

1008
02:28:57,930 --> 02:28:59,806
Mama, I...

1009
02:29:03,185 --> 02:29:05,520
I'm two hours late.

1010
02:29:05,687 --> 02:29:06,813
I know.

1011
02:29:08,440 --> 02:29:10,192
How was your trip?

1012
02:29:10,692 --> 02:29:16,448
Fine. I'm a little tired,
but it was fine.

1013
02:29:31,964 --> 02:29:36,218
My God, it's running slow again.

1014
02:29:37,469 --> 02:29:40,222
- I'll go adjust it.
- You've got plenty of time.

1015
02:30:08,875 --> 02:30:12,713
You know, it's really embarrassing,
but for some reason...

1016
02:30:16,508 --> 02:30:19,344
I've completely forgotten your face.

1017
02:30:20,637 --> 02:30:22,264
You don't look well.

1018
02:30:25,017 --> 02:30:26,018
Are you happy?

1019
02:30:26,143 --> 02:30:29,354
Somehow that concept
seems irrelevant here.

1020
02:30:31,356 --> 02:30:34,609
That's really a pity.

1021
02:30:39,156 --> 02:30:41,283
I'm very lonesome now.

1022
02:30:54,421 --> 02:30:58,258
Why do you hurt our feelings?
What have you been waiting for?

1023
02:31:00,635 --> 02:31:02,429
Why haven't you called?

1024
02:31:20,822 --> 02:31:23,325
You're leading
some sort of strange life.

1025
02:31:24,451 --> 02:31:27,579
You're filthy and unkempt.

1026
02:31:29,581 --> 02:31:31,416
How did you make
such a mess of yourself?

1027
02:31:37,214 --> 02:31:38,465
What's this?

1028
02:31:40,926 --> 02:31:42,928
Wait here. I'll be right back.

1029
02:32:42,654 --> 02:32:44,281
Mama...

1030
02:33:22,068 --> 02:33:23,570
Hari...

1031
02:33:38,710 --> 02:33:40,086
Hari...

1032
02:33:41,338 --> 02:33:43,465
How are you?
Everything all right?

1033
02:33:43,965 --> 02:33:45,967
Where's Hari?

1034
02:33:57,562 --> 02:33:59,064
What's that?

1035
02:33:59,439 --> 02:34:01,107
There's no more Hari.

1036
02:34:26,007 --> 02:34:30,887
"Kris, it's terrible that I had
to deceive you,

1037
02:34:31,346 --> 02:34:33,974
but there was no other way.

1038
02:34:35,392 --> 02:34:38,520
This is best for both of us.

1039
02:34:43,900 --> 02:34:45,986
I asked them myself.

1040
02:34:47,779 --> 02:34:51,783
You mustn't blame anyone.

1041
02:34:53,034 --> 02:34:54,286
Hari."

1042
02:34:59,666 --> 02:35:02,002
She did it for you.

1043
02:35:12,429 --> 02:35:15,557
Snaut, listen.

1044
02:35:16,516 --> 02:35:18,560
Later, Kris. Calm down.

1045
02:35:18,810 --> 02:35:23,315
How... how did it...

1046
02:35:24,566 --> 02:35:27,819
The annihilator?
A burst of light and wind.

1047
02:35:37,704 --> 02:35:39,331
Yes.

1048
02:35:40,332 --> 02:35:43,585
Things weren't working out
between us towards the end.

1049
02:35:49,049 --> 02:35:50,717
Listen, Snaut.

1050
02:35:51,718 --> 02:35:54,346
Why are we being tortured like this?

1051
02:35:57,057 --> 02:36:01,353
In my opinion, we have lost
our sense of the cosmic.

1052
02:36:02,103 --> 02:36:04,230
The ancients understood it perfectly.

1053
02:36:04,481 --> 02:36:07,859
They never would have asked
why or what for.

1054
02:36:08,568 --> 02:36:10,737
Remember the myth of Sisyphus.

1055
02:36:12,989 --> 02:36:16,368
Since we transmitted
your encephalogram,

1056
02:36:16,493 --> 02:36:19,454
none of the guests have come back.

1057
02:36:20,246 --> 02:36:23,958
Something incomprehensible is starting
to take place in the Ocean.

1058
02:36:24,250 --> 02:36:26,753
Islands have begun to form
on the surface.

1059
02:36:27,003 --> 02:36:30,715
First one. Then the next day
there were several more.

1060
02:36:30,840 --> 02:36:33,885
Are you trying to tell me
that it understood us?

1061
02:36:34,260 --> 02:36:36,596
That quickly?

1062
02:36:37,639 --> 02:36:42,394
But at least there's hope, eh, Kris?

1063
02:36:49,651 --> 02:36:52,612
- How old are you?
- Fifty-two. Why?

1064
02:36:54,280 --> 02:36:56,116
Have you been here long?

1065
02:36:57,617 --> 02:37:00,912
- You must have seen my forms.
- I did.

1066
02:37:02,163 --> 02:37:07,502
Listen, having spent so many years
here on the station,

1067
02:37:09,003 --> 02:37:12,924
do you still feel a clear connection
to your life down there?

1068
02:37:13,925 --> 02:37:16,803
You like dire questions.

1069
02:37:17,011 --> 02:37:19,931
Soon you'll ask me
about the meaning of life.

1070
02:37:20,390 --> 02:37:22,809
Wait. Don't be ironic.

1071
02:37:23,017 --> 02:37:25,812
It's a banal question.

1072
02:37:26,438 --> 02:37:28,690
When man is happy,

1073
02:37:28,940 --> 02:37:34,028
the meaning of life and other
eternal themes rarely interest him.

1074
02:37:35,572 --> 02:37:39,325
These questions should be asked
at the end of one's life.

1075
02:37:43,955 --> 02:37:47,834
But we don't know when life will end.

1076
02:37:47,834 --> 02:37:49,586
That's why we're in such a hurry.

1077
02:37:50,044 --> 02:37:51,713
Don't rush.

1078
02:37:51,963 --> 02:37:57,677
The happiest people are those who are
not interested in these cursed questions.

1079
02:37:57,969 --> 02:38:01,055
To ask is always
the desire to know.

1080
02:38:01,097 --> 02:38:04,601
Yet the preservation of
simple human truths requires mystery.

1081
02:38:05,560 --> 02:38:09,355
The mysteries of happiness,
death and love.

1082
02:38:09,689 --> 02:38:13,610
Maybe you're right,
but try not to think about all that now.

1083
02:38:14,694 --> 02:38:19,449
To think about it
is to know the day of one's death.

1084
02:38:21,701 --> 02:38:25,622
Not knowing that day
makes us practically immortal.

1085
02:38:31,461 --> 02:38:32,879
Fine, then.

1086
02:38:33,630 --> 02:38:36,216
In any event,
my mission is finished.

1087
02:38:36,633 --> 02:38:40,220
But what next?
Return to Earth?

1088
02:38:41,638 --> 02:38:43,640
Little by little,
everything will return to normal.

1089
02:38:43,765 --> 02:38:46,267
I'll even find
new interests and acquaintances.

1090
02:38:47,602 --> 02:38:50,021
But I won't be able
to give myself to them fully.

1091
02:38:51,231 --> 02:38:52,732
Never.

1092
02:38:55,527 --> 02:38:57,529
Do I have the right to turn down

1093
02:38:57,904 --> 02:39:03,117
even an imagined possibility
of contact with this Ocean

1094
02:39:03,618 --> 02:39:08,039
which my race has been trying
to understand for decades?

1095
02:39:09,415 --> 02:39:11,167
Should I remain here?

1096
02:39:11,793 --> 02:39:14,921
Among things and objects
we both touched?

1097
02:39:15,296 --> 02:39:18,258
Which still bear the memory
of our breath?

1098
02:39:19,050 --> 02:39:20,510
What for?

1099
02:39:21,302 --> 02:39:23,638
In the hope that she'll return?

1100
02:39:24,180 --> 02:39:26,641
But I don't harbor this hope.

1101
02:39:28,643 --> 02:39:30,395
The only thing left for me

1102
02:39:30,812 --> 02:39:33,064
is to wait.

1103
02:39:34,566 --> 02:39:37,944
I don't know what for.
New miracles?

1104
02:39:44,701 --> 02:39:45,702
Are you tired?

1105
02:39:46,953 --> 02:39:49,831
No, I feel great.

1106
02:39:50,331 --> 02:39:51,708
You know, Kris...

1107
02:39:52,542 --> 02:39:55,670
I think it's time
you returned to Earth.

1108
02:39:57,046 --> 02:39:59,465
You think so?

1109
02:46:18,302 --> 02:46:24,934
THE END
