2
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,595
Our sun is dying.

3
00:00:41,303 --> 00:00:44,170
Mankind faces extinction.

4
00:00:46,141 --> 00:00:50,840
Seven years ago, the Icarus Project
sent a mission to restart the sun.

5
00:00:51,013 --> 00:00:54,813
But that mission was lost
before it reached the star.

6
00:00:56,885 --> 00:01:01,151
Sixteen months ago, I, Robert Capa,
and a crew of seven...

7
00:01:01,323 --> 00:01:04,622
...left Earth frozen in a solar winter.

8
00:01:05,994 --> 00:01:07,518
Our payload...

9
00:01:07,696 --> 00:01:12,633
...a stellar bomb with the mass
equivalent to Manhattan Island.

10
00:01:13,502 --> 00:01:15,470
Our purpose...

11
00:01:16,138 --> 00:01:19,699
...to create a star within a star.

12
00:01:44,466 --> 00:01:48,732
Eight astronauts strapped
to the back of a bomb.

13
00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:50,695
My bomb.

14
00:01:52,307 --> 00:01:54,468
Welcome to Icarus II.

15
00:02:27,042 --> 00:02:28,202
Icarus.

16
00:02:28,744 --> 00:02:30,769
Yes, Dr. Searle?

17
00:02:30,979 --> 00:02:34,437
Please re-filter
the Observation Room portal.

18
00:02:34,616 --> 00:02:38,245
Filter up or down, Dr. Searle?

19
00:02:38,854 --> 00:02:40,549
Down.

20
00:02:44,693 --> 00:02:46,558
Oh, my.

21
00:02:49,498 --> 00:02:54,197
Icarus, how close is this
to full brightness?

22
00:02:54,636 --> 00:02:58,697
At this distance of 36 million miles...

23
00:02:58,874 --> 00:03:03,607
...you are observing the sun
at 2 percent of full brightness.

24
00:03:03,946 --> 00:03:05,004
Two percent?

25
00:03:06,448 --> 00:03:08,143
Can you show me 4 percent?

26
00:03:08,317 --> 00:03:12,754
Four percent would result in
irreversible damage to your retinas.

27
00:03:19,661 --> 00:03:22,994
However, you could observe
3. 1 percent...

28
00:03:23,165 --> 00:03:26,157
...for a period of not longer than
30 seconds.

29
00:03:26,401 --> 00:03:29,336
All right. Icarus, I'm gonna reset...

30
00:03:29,538 --> 00:03:33,634
...the filter to 3.1 percent.

31
00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:12,638
Well, it's invigorating.

32
00:04:12,814 --> 00:04:15,647
It's like taking a shower in light.

33
00:04:15,817 --> 00:04:18,877
- You lose yourself a little.
- Like a flotation tank.

34
00:04:19,087 --> 00:04:20,111
Actually, no.

35
00:04:25,627 --> 00:04:26,992
Look, what is it, beef?

36
00:04:27,162 --> 00:04:28,527
Chicken.

37
00:04:28,697 --> 00:04:31,063
If you don't like it,
you take my shift next time.

38
00:04:31,233 --> 00:04:34,396
For psych tests on deep space,
I ran sensory-deprivation trials.

39
00:04:34,603 --> 00:04:37,037
Testing total darkness
on flotation tanks.

40
00:04:37,205 --> 00:04:41,073
And the point about darkness is,
you float in it.

41
00:04:41,243 --> 00:04:44,076
You and the darkness are distinct
from each other...

42
00:04:44,246 --> 00:04:48,342
...because darkness is an absence
of something, it's a vacuum.

43
00:04:48,517 --> 00:04:51,543
But total light, it envelops you.

44
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,347
It becomes you.

45
00:04:55,891 --> 00:04:57,859
It's very strange. I don't...

46
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,152
I recommend it.

47
00:05:00,329 --> 00:05:03,162
What's strange, Searle,
is that you're the psych officer...

48
00:05:03,332 --> 00:05:05,664
...and I'm clearly a lot saner
than you are.

49
00:05:08,537 --> 00:05:09,561
Good.

50
00:05:24,219 --> 00:05:26,585
All right, if no one's gonna say it,
I'm going to.

51
00:05:26,755 --> 00:05:31,089
The solar wind reading is much higher
than we'd anticipated at this distance.

52
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:34,456
For the moment we can still send
package messages back.

53
00:05:34,663 --> 00:05:37,131
High-frequency bursts will rise
above interference...

54
00:05:37,299 --> 00:05:40,200
...and the Moon Stations
will be able to pick them up.

55
00:05:40,369 --> 00:05:45,602
But it's possible that within 24 hours
we won't be able to communicate at all.

56
00:05:45,774 --> 00:05:47,264
Possible?

57
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:50,071
Probable.

58
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,145
We'll finally be on our own.

59
00:05:54,316 --> 00:05:57,581
We're 55 million miles from Earth.
I'd say we're already on our own.

60
00:05:58,086 --> 00:06:00,919
Come on, guys.
We were expecting this.

61
00:06:01,089 --> 00:06:03,148
No great drama.
We're flying into the dead zone...

62
00:06:03,325 --> 00:06:05,725
...seven days sooner
than we thought.

63
00:06:06,228 --> 00:06:10,096
But if any of you are planning
on sending a final message home...

64
00:06:10,632 --> 00:06:12,395
...you should do it now.

65
00:06:22,811 --> 00:06:25,507
Well, Mom and Dad.

66
00:06:27,516 --> 00:06:29,814
I hope you're proud of your son...

67
00:06:29,985 --> 00:06:32,818
...saving mankind and so on.

68
00:07:01,616 --> 00:07:05,985
By the time you get this message,
I'll be in the dead zone.

69
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:09,851
It came a little sooner
than we thought.

70
00:07:10,292 --> 00:07:14,251
But this means that you won't be able
to send a message back.

71
00:07:15,497 --> 00:07:20,161
So I just wanted to let you know
that I don't need the message.

72
00:07:20,869 --> 00:07:24,828
Because I know everything
you wanna say.

73
00:07:32,514 --> 00:07:38,680
Just remember it takes eight minutes
for light to travel from sun to Earth.

74
00:07:38,854 --> 00:07:40,913
Which means you'll know
we've succeeded...

75
00:07:41,089 --> 00:07:44,354
...about eight minutes
after we deliver the payload.

76
00:07:44,526 --> 00:07:49,054
All you have to do is look out
for a little extra brightness in the sky.

77
00:07:49,231 --> 00:07:53,565
So, if you wake up one morning,
and it's a particularly beautiful day...

78
00:07:53,735 --> 00:07:55,726
...you'll know we made it.

79
00:07:58,006 --> 00:07:59,598
Okay.

80
00:07:59,841 --> 00:08:01,706
I'm signing out.

81
00:08:02,744 --> 00:08:05,042
And I'll see you in a couple of years.

82
00:08:53,094 --> 00:08:55,619
Icarus, dial it down a little, will you?

83
00:08:55,797 --> 00:08:58,061
Yes, Corazon.

84
00:09:02,971 --> 00:09:04,871
Captain?

85
00:09:07,676 --> 00:09:09,303
Captain?

86
00:09:11,813 --> 00:09:14,611
I'm guessing you've been
talking to Searle.

87
00:09:17,018 --> 00:09:19,145
- So, do you have that report for me?
- Yeah.

88
00:09:19,321 --> 00:09:20,618
Right here.

89
00:09:22,257 --> 00:09:26,125
The O2 productivity is good. In fact,
if anything, we're over-producing.

90
00:09:26,294 --> 00:09:28,990
It will trail off dramatically
when we get nearer.

91
00:09:29,164 --> 00:09:33,897
But in truth, we have the reserves
to make it there and a quarter-way back.

92
00:09:36,171 --> 00:09:38,696
You're thinking about Icarus I.

93
00:09:40,508 --> 00:09:43,534
Well, whatever it was
that tripped them up...

94
00:09:43,712 --> 00:09:46,681
...I don't think
it was a lack of oxygen.

95
00:09:47,115 --> 00:09:49,845
Not on the outward journey,
at any rate.

96
00:09:51,286 --> 00:09:52,981
Fuck.

97
00:09:56,057 --> 00:09:57,524
Fuck.

98
00:09:59,794 --> 00:10:02,922
- Mace.
- Mace.

99
00:10:03,365 --> 00:10:05,060
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

100
00:10:05,233 --> 00:10:07,133
- Fuck.
- Relax. Put it down.

101
00:10:07,302 --> 00:10:08,360
You son of a bitch.

102
00:10:10,739 --> 00:10:12,331
- Fucker took an hour in there.
- Stop.

103
00:10:12,507 --> 00:10:14,839
I can't send my package,
the wind is too high.

104
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:18,411
- Calm down.
- I'm sorry, all right? Jesus.

105
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:21,413
Kaneda, Searle, report to Flight Deck.

106
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,346
What's up?

107
00:10:23,685 --> 00:10:27,644
We have an excess of manliness
breaking out in the Comms Center.

108
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,684
So how does this work?

109
00:10:32,894 --> 00:10:35,089
Am I supposed to tell you
about my childhood?

110
00:10:35,263 --> 00:10:38,391
I probably know more
about your childhood than you do.

111
00:10:44,472 --> 00:10:45,598
It's the time.

112
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:51,770
Sixteen months,
you can get used to anything.

113
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,747
You just...

114
00:10:54,282 --> 00:10:56,011
...lose track.

115
00:11:00,422 --> 00:11:02,583
I know I fucked up.

116
00:11:08,797 --> 00:11:10,560
From now on...

117
00:11:10,732 --> 00:11:13,428
...I'm not gonna lose track again.

118
00:11:15,603 --> 00:11:17,002
Prescription...

119
00:11:18,306 --> 00:11:20,467
...Earth Room.

120
00:11:20,642 --> 00:11:22,041
Two hours?

121
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:25,943
- And get a haircut, Mace.
- Yeah.

122
00:11:40,628 --> 00:11:41,822
Bring back the waves.

123
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:45,898
Dr. Searle's prescription specifies
a peaceful module.

124
00:11:46,067 --> 00:11:47,728
The waves make me feel peaceful.

125
00:11:57,479 --> 00:11:59,242
Again.

126
00:12:17,265 --> 00:12:19,961
Mace, I'm sorry.
I should have let you go first.

127
00:12:20,135 --> 00:12:23,468
Capa. It's me.
I'm the one apologizing, all right?

128
00:12:23,872 --> 00:12:25,430
All right.

129
00:12:30,979 --> 00:12:32,708
- Was that the apology?
- Yeah.

130
00:12:32,881 --> 00:12:35,315
- Consider it accepted.
- Okay.

131
00:13:00,508 --> 00:13:04,137
It was a sequence of contact reports
on the top-left shield quadrant...

132
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:09,475
...which, by 1700, had turned
into a minor asteroid storm.

133
00:13:09,651 --> 00:13:11,676
None bigger than a raindrop...

134
00:13:11,853 --> 00:13:13,411
...but we had 19 punctures...

135
00:13:13,621 --> 00:13:16,920
...and a secondary contact
to the engine compartment.

136
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:19,821
Took three alpha shifts to patch it up.

137
00:13:19,994 --> 00:13:22,827
Lost a little vapor. Nothing serious.

138
00:13:23,331 --> 00:13:26,061
I watched them hit us
from the Observation Room.

139
00:13:26,534 --> 00:13:29,128
Gotta tell you, Moon Base, it was...

140
00:13:29,938 --> 00:13:31,667
It was...

141
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,767
...beautiful.

142
00:13:35,276 --> 00:13:37,836
Gotta tell you, Moon Base, it was...

143
00:13:38,713 --> 00:13:40,374
It was...

144
00:13:40,849 --> 00:13:42,680
...beautiful.

145
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,925
- Mace?
- Yeah.

146
00:14:01,102 --> 00:14:04,071
Your maintenance program
allows a further 14 minutes...

147
00:14:04,239 --> 00:14:07,675
...for the mainframe panel
to remain out of coolant tank.

148
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:10,768
Shit.

149
00:14:35,803 --> 00:14:36,963
Guys...

150
00:14:37,138 --> 00:14:39,003
...you wanna see something?

151
00:14:42,076 --> 00:14:45,136
Well, I should have
a few words to say...

152
00:14:45,313 --> 00:14:47,178
...but on reflection...

153
00:14:47,348 --> 00:14:48,838
...what can one say?

154
00:14:49,017 --> 00:14:51,212
Ladies and gentlemen.

155
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,244
Mercury.

156
00:16:30,685 --> 00:16:33,882
Twenty-three hours ago,
on the comms systems...

157
00:16:34,055 --> 00:16:35,750
While listening to your space music?

158
00:16:35,923 --> 00:16:39,359
- While scanning the frequencies,
I heard a transmission.

159
00:16:40,895 --> 00:16:43,557
It appeared as we flew
into the dark side of Mercury.

160
00:16:43,731 --> 00:16:45,392
The iron content of the planet...

161
00:16:45,566 --> 00:16:46,931
...is acting as an antenna.

162
00:16:47,101 --> 00:16:50,593
There's high background interference,
but the signal is clear enough.

163
00:16:50,772 --> 00:16:54,572
Icarus, please play audio file 7-5/B.

164
00:16:54,742 --> 00:16:56,835
Yes, Harvey.

165
00:17:13,428 --> 00:17:14,452
End file.

166
00:17:15,396 --> 00:17:17,057
What is it?

167
00:17:17,665 --> 00:17:19,428
It's the Icarus I.

168
00:17:21,169 --> 00:17:23,137
That signal is their distress beacon.

169
00:17:23,304 --> 00:17:24,601
Jesus.

170
00:17:24,772 --> 00:17:26,831
That's impossible.
It's been seven years.

171
00:17:27,008 --> 00:17:29,602
Clearly it's not impossible
because you can hear it.

172
00:17:29,777 --> 00:17:31,802
- They're still alive?
- We don't know.

173
00:17:31,979 --> 00:17:34,174
But they could be.
Oxygen is self-replenishing.

174
00:17:34,382 --> 00:17:35,940
Water is recycled.

175
00:17:36,117 --> 00:17:37,914
They have the solar power
they need.

176
00:17:38,086 --> 00:17:40,782
What about food?
Their supplies couldn't last.

177
00:17:40,955 --> 00:17:42,320
That depends.

178
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:45,118
They had stock to cover eight people
for three years.

179
00:17:45,293 --> 00:17:47,193
That's a four-year shortfall.
Hell of a diet.

180
00:17:47,395 --> 00:17:49,363
We don't know what happened
to Icarus I.

181
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,657
There might have been an accident.

182
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:54,028
There might not have been
eight people to feed.

183
00:17:54,202 --> 00:17:58,161
- Captain, do we know where they are?
- Well done, Capa. That is the question.

184
00:17:59,107 --> 00:18:00,938
Icarus.

185
00:18:01,409 --> 00:18:04,970
Please plot our trajectory following
the slingshot around Mercury.

186
00:18:05,146 --> 00:18:07,114
Yes, captain.

187
00:18:09,517 --> 00:18:13,112
Now plot the source
of the Icarus I beacon.

188
00:18:18,326 --> 00:18:20,294
Jesus. They almost made it.

189
00:18:20,461 --> 00:18:22,929
That's why no one picked up
the signal until now.

190
00:18:24,065 --> 00:18:26,226
It was lost in the background light
and noise.

191
00:18:26,434 --> 00:18:27,901
We're gonna pass right by them.

192
00:18:28,069 --> 00:18:31,402
Within 1 o or 15 thousand miles.

193
00:18:31,572 --> 00:18:33,563
Can anyone survive?

194
00:18:33,741 --> 00:18:36,301
If the shield is intact.

195
00:18:36,644 --> 00:18:38,737
We'll be able to see them?

196
00:18:39,714 --> 00:18:41,079
Yes.

197
00:18:41,249 --> 00:18:45,185
I'd need to look at all of this
pretty carefully. Very carefully.

198
00:18:45,353 --> 00:18:50,586
But if I had to make a guess right now,
I'd say we could adjust our trajectory.

199
00:18:50,992 --> 00:18:52,482
We could fly straight to them.

200
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,218
But we're not gonna do that.

201
00:18:57,732 --> 00:19:01,668
Just to make it absolutely clear,
there's no way we're gonna do that.

202
00:19:04,739 --> 00:19:07,264
Do I have to spell it out for you?

203
00:19:07,475 --> 00:19:10,410
We have a payload to deliver
to the heart of our nearest star.

204
00:19:10,578 --> 00:19:13,012
We're doing it
because that star is dying.

205
00:19:13,181 --> 00:19:15,046
And if it dies, we die.

206
00:19:15,216 --> 00:19:16,547
Everything dies.

207
00:19:16,717 --> 00:19:18,514
So that is our mission.
There is nothing...

208
00:19:18,686 --> 00:19:22,452
...literally nothing, more important than
completing our mission. End of story.

209
00:19:22,623 --> 00:19:25,091
- He's right.
- He's right. Of course I'm right.

210
00:19:25,259 --> 00:19:27,557
Is anyone here seriously
considering otherwise?

211
00:19:27,728 --> 00:19:29,423
- May I put a counter argument?
- No.

212
00:19:29,597 --> 00:19:30,962
Captain?

213
00:19:31,132 --> 00:19:32,258
Go ahead.

214
00:19:33,034 --> 00:19:35,127
It would, of course...

215
00:19:35,303 --> 00:19:39,740
...be absurd to alter our trajectory
to assist the crew of the Icarus I.

216
00:19:39,907 --> 00:19:43,274
Even if we knew that some or
even all of that crew are still alive...

217
00:19:43,778 --> 00:19:48,806
...their lives are expendable
when seen in the context of our mission.

218
00:19:49,951 --> 00:19:50,975
As are our own lives.

219
00:19:51,152 --> 00:19:52,744
- Exactly.
- However...

220
00:19:53,654 --> 00:19:57,146
...there is something onboard the
Icarus I that may be worth the detour.

221
00:19:57,325 --> 00:19:59,953
As you pointed out, Mace,
we have a payload to deliver.

222
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,151
A payload. Singular.

223
00:20:01,329 --> 00:20:04,890
Now, everything about the delivery
and effectiveness of that payload...

224
00:20:05,099 --> 00:20:07,624
...is entirely theoretical.

225
00:20:07,802 --> 00:20:09,463
Simply put...

226
00:20:09,637 --> 00:20:12,003
...we don't know if it's gonna work.

227
00:20:12,173 --> 00:20:15,404
But what we do know is this...

228
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:18,940
...if we had two bombs,
we'd have two chances.

229
00:20:19,113 --> 00:20:21,980
You're assuming
we'd be able to pilot Icarus I.

230
00:20:22,149 --> 00:20:23,173
- Yes.
- Which is assuming...

231
00:20:23,351 --> 00:20:27,811
...that whatever stopped them wasn't
a fault or a damage to the spacecraft.

232
00:20:27,989 --> 00:20:29,957
- Yes.
- It's a lot of assumptions.

233
00:20:30,124 --> 00:20:31,148
It is.

234
00:20:31,325 --> 00:20:32,622
It's a risk assessment.

235
00:20:32,793 --> 00:20:33,817
The question is:

236
00:20:33,995 --> 00:20:37,931
Does the risk of a detour outweigh
the benefits of an extra payload?

237
00:20:47,141 --> 00:20:48,472
- We'll have a vote.
- No, no.

238
00:20:48,976 --> 00:20:50,307
No, we won't.

239
00:20:51,512 --> 00:20:53,139
We are not a democracy.

240
00:20:54,782 --> 00:20:57,683
We're a collection of astronauts
and scientists.

241
00:20:57,852 --> 00:21:01,310
So we're gonna make the most
informed decision available to us.

242
00:21:01,489 --> 00:21:02,786
Made by you, by any chance?

243
00:21:02,957 --> 00:21:06,154
Made by the person best qualified
to understand the complexities...

244
00:21:06,327 --> 00:21:08,295
...of a payload delivery.

245
00:21:08,729 --> 00:21:10,196
Our physicist.

246
00:21:18,239 --> 00:21:19,866
Shit.

247
00:21:24,812 --> 00:21:29,249
Okay, Icarus, run the math on the
successful delivery of the payload.

248
00:21:29,417 --> 00:21:31,749
Okay, payload delivery point reached.

249
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,045
Detach the payload.

250
00:21:33,621 --> 00:21:36,647
Stellar bomb initiated and detached.

251
00:21:36,824 --> 00:21:39,258
Crew and living section
have four minutes...

252
00:21:39,427 --> 00:21:42,260
...to clear and commence
homeward journey.

253
00:21:42,697 --> 00:21:47,259
And four minutes after separation,
boosters automatically fire.

254
00:21:47,435 --> 00:21:52,202
Payload boosters will automatically
fire after four-minute delay.

255
00:21:52,373 --> 00:21:54,864
Entering coronal hole
in South Polar Cap.

256
00:21:55,042 --> 00:21:56,703
Magnetic field structure open.

257
00:21:56,877 --> 00:21:59,437
Temperature, 37,000.

258
00:21:59,647 --> 00:22:03,344
Reliability of projection has dropped
below 45 percent.

259
00:22:03,517 --> 00:22:07,044
Remaining projection is not open
to useful speculation.

260
00:22:07,221 --> 00:22:08,779
Variables infinite.

261
00:22:08,956 --> 00:22:10,287
Accuracy unknown.

262
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:12,085
That's the problem right there.

263
00:22:12,259 --> 00:22:14,625
Between the boosters
and the gravity of the sun...

264
00:22:14,795 --> 00:22:16,626
...the velocity will be so great...

265
00:22:16,797 --> 00:22:19,129
...space and time
will become smeared together.

266
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:22,428
Everything will distort,
everything will be unquantifiable.

267
00:22:22,603 --> 00:22:25,401
You have to come down on one side
or the other.

268
00:22:25,706 --> 00:22:29,574
- I need a decision.
- It's not a decision, it's a guess.

269
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:34,108
It's like flipping a coin and asking me
to decide whether it'll be heads or tails.

270
00:22:35,049 --> 00:22:36,607
And?

271
00:22:37,718 --> 00:22:39,083
Heads.

272
00:22:44,091 --> 00:22:47,549
We've mined all Earth's fissile
materials for this bomb.

273
00:22:47,962 --> 00:22:50,590
There's not gonna be
another payload.

274
00:22:52,199 --> 00:22:54,997
The one we carry is our last chance.

275
00:22:55,202 --> 00:22:58,933
Our last best hope.

276
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:04,901
Searle's argument is sound.

277
00:23:05,246 --> 00:23:07,214
Two last hopes are better than one.

278
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,717
That's it.

279
00:23:27,735 --> 00:23:29,327
Slingshot complete.

280
00:23:29,503 --> 00:23:32,631
Icarus leaving Mercury orbit.

281
00:24:00,968 --> 00:24:02,026
Hey.

282
00:24:02,203 --> 00:24:04,034
Hey.

283
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:11,073
Good dream?

284
00:24:12,213 --> 00:24:13,544
Let me guess.

285
00:24:13,881 --> 00:24:15,849
The surface of the sun?

286
00:24:17,852 --> 00:24:19,786
Only dream I ever have.

287
00:24:20,421 --> 00:24:23,720
Every time I shut my eyes
it's always the same.

288
00:24:25,392 --> 00:24:28,020
Maybe you should talk
to Dr. Searle about that.

289
00:24:28,696 --> 00:24:31,290
See if he can help you out.

290
00:24:33,801 --> 00:24:35,530
Maybe.

291
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,439
I just wanted to let you know...

292
00:24:42,042 --> 00:24:44,567
...I think you made the right decision.

293
00:24:45,746 --> 00:24:47,213
Well.

294
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:54,251
Mace doesn't and I'm guessing Harvey
and Trey don't either.

295
00:24:54,421 --> 00:24:55,888
Yeah...

296
00:24:56,323 --> 00:24:58,052
...but I do.

297
00:25:24,385 --> 00:25:26,819
- Get the alarm. What's going on?
- I screwed up.

298
00:25:26,987 --> 00:25:28,921
It's not you. It's my responsibility.

299
00:25:29,089 --> 00:25:31,319
- We shouldn't be straying.
- Trey, cut to it.

300
00:25:31,492 --> 00:25:34,928
In order to change the route,
I had to manually override Icarus.

301
00:25:35,095 --> 00:25:38,758
So I made all the calculations myself.
And I double- and triple-checked them.

302
00:25:38,933 --> 00:25:40,127
They all worked out.

303
00:25:40,301 --> 00:25:43,270
So I set the new coordinates
and put us on our way.

304
00:25:43,437 --> 00:25:45,632
What's the problem?
The trajectory is wrong?

305
00:25:45,806 --> 00:25:47,068
The trajectory is good.

306
00:25:47,675 --> 00:25:51,907
But it changes our angle of approach
to the sun by 1.1 degrees.

307
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:54,877
You didn't reset the shields
to the new angle.

308
00:25:58,118 --> 00:26:00,450
Jesus Christ, Trey.

309
00:26:00,921 --> 00:26:02,786
I forgot.

310
00:26:05,626 --> 00:26:10,791
My head was full of velocities and fuel
calculations and a million different...

311
00:26:10,965 --> 00:26:13,763
I fucked up, all right?

312
00:26:15,536 --> 00:26:17,265
People do shit.

313
00:26:17,438 --> 00:26:19,167
They get stressed...

314
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,974
...and fuck up.

315
00:26:22,776 --> 00:26:24,004
I fucked up.

316
00:26:24,178 --> 00:26:26,009
Trey.

317
00:26:30,851 --> 00:26:33,843
The fact is, we're still alive.

318
00:26:34,989 --> 00:26:37,514
A hole hasn't burnt
in the side of the ship.

319
00:26:37,691 --> 00:26:39,818
We don't have
a 1 o, ooo-degree climate.

320
00:26:39,994 --> 00:26:42,861
- So, what's the actual damage?
- We don't know.

321
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:46,557
Icarus tried to reset the shields
independently when the alarm triggered.

322
00:26:46,734 --> 00:26:48,827
But all the sensors up there are
burned out.

323
00:26:49,003 --> 00:26:51,563
So we have no idea of the state
of the affected area.

324
00:26:52,506 --> 00:26:55,134
Only way we're gonna know
is if we go out there.

325
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:58,334
Okay.

326
00:26:58,512 --> 00:27:00,343
I'll get suited up.

327
00:27:00,514 --> 00:27:02,414
It's a two-man job.

328
00:27:02,583 --> 00:27:05,177
As second in command,
you're not going anywhere.

329
00:27:05,352 --> 00:27:07,343
- I volunteer.
- No, I volunteer.

330
00:27:08,155 --> 00:27:09,247
Fine.

331
00:27:09,456 --> 00:27:11,583
I volunteer Capa.

332
00:27:15,896 --> 00:27:17,261
Sure.

333
00:27:17,464 --> 00:27:18,829
I'll do it.

334
00:27:20,901 --> 00:27:22,459
Okay.

335
00:27:48,062 --> 00:27:49,427
Okay.

336
00:28:28,769 --> 00:28:31,795
You've done this a thousand times
in Earth-orbit training.

337
00:28:32,606 --> 00:28:34,073
Yeah.

338
00:28:34,241 --> 00:28:35,970
You're gonna be fine.

339
00:28:36,143 --> 00:28:37,167
Okay?

340
00:28:49,757 --> 00:28:50,781
Okay, Icarus.

341
00:28:50,958 --> 00:28:52,949
I'm gonna be taking
control for a while.

342
00:28:53,127 --> 00:28:55,425
- Okay, Cassie.
- I'm gonna be cutting speed.

343
00:28:55,596 --> 00:28:58,588
I'm gonna rotate us so the damage
is facing away from the sun.

344
00:28:58,766 --> 00:29:01,098
- Do we understand each other?
- Yes, Cassie.

345
00:29:01,268 --> 00:29:04,431
Rotate by that much, we're gonna
lose comm towers three and four.

346
00:29:04,605 --> 00:29:07,096
Well, it's a good thing
we don't need them, then.

347
00:29:07,274 --> 00:29:09,970
We don't need them now,
we're gonna need them to go home.

348
00:29:10,144 --> 00:29:12,169
We'll cross that bridge when
we come to it.

349
00:29:12,346 --> 00:29:15,975
In the meantime, I'm gonna try and
give them as much shadow as I can.

350
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:17,310
All right, guys.

351
00:29:17,484 --> 00:29:19,213
I'm opening up.

352
00:29:51,485 --> 00:29:53,419
Okay.

353
00:29:58,992 --> 00:30:01,483
Helmet-cam operational.

354
00:30:01,662 --> 00:30:03,425
Affirmative. Good image.

355
00:30:05,866 --> 00:30:07,857
Capa, check,
helmet-cam fully operational.

356
00:30:08,035 --> 00:30:09,696
Affirmative.

357
00:30:13,574 --> 00:30:16,907
Exiting airlock with maintenance
modules.

358
00:30:30,591 --> 00:30:34,459
Moving down
to investigate damaged area.

359
00:30:35,295 --> 00:30:37,195
Okay, guys.

360
00:30:37,364 --> 00:30:39,059
Nice and easy.

361
00:30:40,033 --> 00:30:41,796
Nice and easy.

362
00:30:41,969 --> 00:30:43,732
Copy.

363
00:30:56,216 --> 00:30:59,242
Icarus, please adjust shield
to allow for rotation.

364
00:30:59,453 --> 00:31:01,580
Yes, Cassie.

365
00:31:29,783 --> 00:31:32,217
Establishing new alignment to sun.

366
00:31:34,821 --> 00:31:36,448
Jesus.

367
00:31:36,623 --> 00:31:38,750
That's the temperature change
on the shields.

368
00:31:38,926 --> 00:31:41,451
The metal's just contracting
and expanding.

369
00:31:41,628 --> 00:31:44,290
I know what it is, flyboy.

370
00:31:52,639 --> 00:31:55,472
It sounds like she's tearing apart.

371
00:32:16,697 --> 00:32:20,497
Fatal damage to Comms Towers
3 and 4.

372
00:32:20,667 --> 00:32:24,000
Copy, Icarus. Loss of towers
3 and 4. Cancel alarm.

373
00:32:24,171 --> 00:32:27,334
Shut down sensor
to Comms Tower 3 and 4.

374
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:40,076
You should see it up here, guys.

375
00:32:40,988 --> 00:32:43,183
It's pretty impressive.

376
00:32:54,935 --> 00:32:56,402
Okay.

377
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:59,539
There are four damaged panels.

378
00:33:02,509 --> 00:33:05,444
They're about 300 meters out.

379
00:33:18,191 --> 00:33:21,456
Capa, take it easy. You're going
through your O2 pretty fast.

380
00:33:23,263 --> 00:33:25,356
Copy that, Cory.

381
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:32,700
That's it.
Slow down the breathing.

382
00:33:32,873 --> 00:33:34,864
Relaxed movement.

383
00:33:54,761 --> 00:33:57,127
Approaching the first panel.

384
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,148
We were lucky.

385
00:34:21,321 --> 00:34:23,619
Can you guys see this?

386
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:24,848
We can see it.

387
00:34:25,025 --> 00:34:27,425
The hydraulics are burnt out.

388
00:34:27,594 --> 00:34:29,892
Let's get this closed.

389
00:34:51,418 --> 00:34:53,409
Okay, Mace.

390
00:34:53,787 --> 00:34:54,913
That's it.

391
00:34:59,493 --> 00:35:01,120
That's the first one closed.

392
00:35:01,294 --> 00:35:02,886
You can do it?

393
00:35:03,063 --> 00:35:04,360
It'll take a while, but...

394
00:35:05,632 --> 00:35:07,293
Yeah.

395
00:35:08,068 --> 00:35:09,126
We can do it.

396
00:35:11,071 --> 00:35:12,936
Great job.

397
00:35:21,014 --> 00:35:22,538
Lots of smiling faces
in this room, guys.

398
00:35:22,749 --> 00:35:24,717
- Great job.
- I love you, captain.

399
00:35:34,327 --> 00:35:36,591
Moving to next panel.

400
00:35:36,963 --> 00:35:38,760
Three to go.

401
00:35:59,252 --> 00:36:00,776
Hey.

402
00:36:02,355 --> 00:36:04,414
Don't kill yourself, man.
We got this, okay?

403
00:36:07,427 --> 00:36:08,689
What's going on, guys?

404
00:36:09,196 --> 00:36:10,356
The ship's moving.

405
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:12,259
We're venting O2. Shit.

406
00:36:12,432 --> 00:36:13,865
I think we're venting O2.

407
00:36:14,034 --> 00:36:15,899
Resuming computer control
of Icarus II.

408
00:36:16,069 --> 00:36:17,696
Negative, Icarus. Manual control.

409
00:36:17,871 --> 00:36:19,702
Negative, Cassie. Computer control.

410
00:36:19,873 --> 00:36:22,364
- Returning vessel to original rotation.
- What?

411
00:36:22,542 --> 00:36:24,635
Icarus, override computer
to manual control.

412
00:36:24,811 --> 00:36:26,472
Negative. Mission in jeopardy.

413
00:36:26,646 --> 00:36:29,615
Override command statement to
manual flight controls removed.

414
00:36:29,783 --> 00:36:31,114
- Why?
- Negative, Icarus.

415
00:36:31,284 --> 00:36:32,945
Negative. State reason immediately.

416
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,553
Fire in oxygen garden.

417
00:36:40,527 --> 00:36:41,789
No.

418
00:36:44,631 --> 00:36:45,655
Seal oxygen feed.

419
00:36:45,832 --> 00:36:48,801
- Fireguard perimeter.
- Sealing sector. Sealing feed.

420
00:36:51,338 --> 00:36:54,273
- Seal sections five through nine.
- Sealing five through nine.

421
00:36:57,444 --> 00:36:59,469
Kaneda, Capa,
get back to the airlock now.

422
00:36:59,646 --> 00:37:01,045
Can't.

423
00:37:02,315 --> 00:37:04,749
Can't leave upright panels.

424
00:37:05,285 --> 00:37:08,152
The ship will burn up if the shields
are not repaired.

425
00:37:08,321 --> 00:37:09,652
- They're gonna die.
- Don't.

426
00:37:09,823 --> 00:37:11,518
- They're gonna burn.
- They are not.

427
00:37:11,691 --> 00:37:13,283
Override Icarus. Cassie, pilot...

428
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:15,519
...emergency command 0-0-0.

429
00:37:15,695 --> 00:37:17,492
Copy command 0-0-0.

430
00:37:17,664 --> 00:37:20,292
- Second human confirmation required.
- Copy.

431
00:37:20,467 --> 00:37:21,491
Mace?

432
00:37:22,202 --> 00:37:23,362
Mace?

433
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:24,594
Wait, Cassie.

434
00:37:27,307 --> 00:37:28,638
Jesus Christ, Harvey.

435
00:37:29,476 --> 00:37:32,343
Harvey, comms officer,
confirm back-up o-o-o.

436
00:37:32,512 --> 00:37:33,979
Override command confirmed.

437
00:37:34,147 --> 00:37:35,842
Manual control returned.

438
00:37:36,016 --> 00:37:37,210
No.

439
00:37:37,784 --> 00:37:39,183
Icarus, continue procedure.

440
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,078
What?

441
00:37:41,655 --> 00:37:42,815
Captain.

442
00:37:43,657 --> 00:37:45,989
- Back me up.
- Copy, Mace.

443
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:48,525
Crew priority
is to protect the payload.

444
00:37:49,129 --> 00:37:50,562
Get the fire out.

445
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:53,130
Icarus, take control of the ship.

446
00:37:53,733 --> 00:37:56,463
- Affirmative, captain.
- Damn it.

447
00:37:59,005 --> 00:38:02,304
Returning vessel to original rotation.

448
00:38:17,657 --> 00:38:19,522
- Let me in. Please.
- Negative.

449
00:38:19,693 --> 00:38:22,127
Door sealed by operating superior
comms officer.

450
00:38:22,495 --> 00:38:23,894
You motherfucker.

451
00:38:24,064 --> 00:38:25,190
Let me in.

452
00:38:27,734 --> 00:38:29,861
Hazard diagnostic complete.

453
00:38:30,036 --> 00:38:31,765
Sprinkler system failing.

454
00:38:31,938 --> 00:38:34,236
Fire will burn for six hours.

455
00:38:34,407 --> 00:38:36,705
Sixty percent chance
of containment failure.

456
00:38:36,876 --> 00:38:40,937
Seventy-five percent chance of collateral
damage to life-support systems.

457
00:38:41,147 --> 00:38:43,138
What are we gonna do?

458
00:38:44,184 --> 00:38:46,049
- Flood it with O2.
- What?

459
00:38:46,219 --> 00:38:48,585
Lt'll cause a flashover.
Make it burn itself out.

460
00:38:48,755 --> 00:38:50,347
We'll lose the whole garden.

461
00:38:50,523 --> 00:38:51,547
We already lost it.

462
00:38:52,392 --> 00:38:54,087
Jesus, Mace, I don't know.

463
00:38:54,561 --> 00:38:56,461
Icarus, open the O2 tanks.

464
00:38:56,663 --> 00:38:58,255
Cory, get the hell out of there.

465
00:38:58,431 --> 00:39:00,058
Opening O2 tanks.

466
00:39:04,237 --> 00:39:05,966
No.

467
00:39:22,322 --> 00:39:25,951
Eighty-nine percent of shield
in full sunlight.

468
00:39:44,444 --> 00:39:47,140
Capa, go back.

469
00:39:47,414 --> 00:39:49,314
I'll finish this.

470
00:39:49,482 --> 00:39:50,506
Please, I can do this.

471
00:39:53,253 --> 00:39:54,811
Go.

472
00:40:03,363 --> 00:40:05,331
Capa returning to airlock.

473
00:40:05,498 --> 00:40:06,863
Do you copy?

474
00:40:09,035 --> 00:40:12,163
Capa returning to airlock.
Do you copy?

475
00:40:12,338 --> 00:40:15,102
Copy, Capa. Hurry.

476
00:40:16,443 --> 00:40:20,004
Ninety-one percent of shield
in full sunlight.

477
00:40:44,404 --> 00:40:48,135
Ninety-four percent of shield
in full sunlight.

478
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:57,682
Captain? Captain?
I'm at the edge of the shield.

479
00:40:58,184 --> 00:40:59,776
Do you copy?

480
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:02,688
Captain, you must leave now.
Captain?

481
00:41:02,856 --> 00:41:06,155
Ninety-seven percent of shield
in full sunlight.

482
00:41:06,326 --> 00:41:09,386
Final panel closing.
The shield is secure.

483
00:41:09,562 --> 00:41:10,893
You have to move now.

484
00:41:11,064 --> 00:41:13,555
Captain, it's right on you.

485
00:41:13,733 --> 00:41:16,258
- Kaneda's not gonna make it.
- You have to move.

486
00:41:16,436 --> 00:41:18,404
You have to move now.

487
00:41:18,571 --> 00:41:19,663
It's too far.

488
00:41:21,174 --> 00:41:23,301
Captain, move.

489
00:41:24,878 --> 00:41:26,402
Why isn't he moving?

490
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,540
Kaneda.

491
00:41:28,715 --> 00:41:30,273
What do you see?

492
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:32,782
Searle, tell our captain to move.

493
00:41:32,952 --> 00:41:36,046
Kaneda, what can you see?

494
00:41:36,222 --> 00:41:38,019
Searle, do you copy?

495
00:41:54,073 --> 00:41:55,335
Kaneda?

496
00:42:26,439 --> 00:42:29,272
Shield rotation complete.

497
00:42:55,335 --> 00:42:57,303
The breakdown is as follows.

498
00:42:57,470 --> 00:42:59,301
Trey is sedated in the Med Centre.

499
00:42:59,472 --> 00:43:02,134
Dr. Searle has diagnosed him
as a suicide risk.

500
00:43:03,676 --> 00:43:06,611
I don't think any of us
are about to question that diagnosis.

501
00:43:06,779 --> 00:43:10,545
As second in command,
I am now the captain of Icarus II.

502
00:43:10,717 --> 00:43:13,049
Thanks both to Kaneda...

503
00:43:13,219 --> 00:43:16,279
...and Capa, our shields are intact.

504
00:43:16,456 --> 00:43:18,720
As is the payload.

505
00:43:19,225 --> 00:43:22,661
But the oxygen garden
is totally destroyed.

506
00:43:23,129 --> 00:43:26,997
In addition, a large amount of O2
was burned in the fire.

507
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:28,733
As it stands now...

508
00:43:29,869 --> 00:43:34,499
...we don't have enough oxygen reserves
to get us to our payload delivery point.

509
00:43:36,175 --> 00:43:38,507
Let alone to survive
the return journey.

510
00:43:38,678 --> 00:43:41,511
So cancel the ticker-tape parade.

511
00:43:44,851 --> 00:43:48,947
We now have no choice
but to rendezvous with Icarus I.

512
00:43:49,889 --> 00:43:52,323
If we're gonna complete
the mission...

513
00:43:52,492 --> 00:43:55,188
...the Icarus I is our only hope.

514
00:44:07,273 --> 00:44:09,901
Technically, he made a mistake.

515
00:44:10,076 --> 00:44:11,668
What are you trying to say, Cory?

516
00:44:11,844 --> 00:44:15,507
Harvey said there's not enough oxygen
to get us to the delivery point.

517
00:44:15,682 --> 00:44:17,707
But there is.

518
00:44:19,018 --> 00:44:22,613
There just isn't enough oxygen
to get all of us there.

519
00:44:23,523 --> 00:44:26,185
Are you suggesting
we let Trey kill himself?

520
00:44:26,359 --> 00:44:27,917
No.

521
00:44:28,995 --> 00:44:31,122
And in any case...

522
00:44:31,631 --> 00:44:34,122
...Trey wouldn't be enough.

523
00:44:35,234 --> 00:44:37,532
We need to lose two more.

524
00:44:43,009 --> 00:44:46,103
Three out of seven.
That's a lot of short straws.

525
00:45:27,453 --> 00:45:29,751
Capa, it's me.

526
00:45:35,328 --> 00:45:36,920
It's different.

527
00:45:37,096 --> 00:45:40,259
Being afraid
that you won't make it back home.

528
00:45:40,933 --> 00:45:44,630
And then knowing that you won't.

529
00:45:46,305 --> 00:45:49,297
Our survival depends
on what we can salvage from Icarus I.

530
00:45:49,475 --> 00:45:50,999
No.

531
00:45:52,378 --> 00:45:53,606
We're gonna die out here.

532
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:56,707
Like the other crew.

533
00:45:57,116 --> 00:45:58,845
I know it.

534
00:46:00,887 --> 00:46:02,582
So do you.

535
00:46:06,192 --> 00:46:07,284
Are you scared?

536
00:46:16,335 --> 00:46:18,394
When the stellar bomb is triggered...

537
00:46:19,605 --> 00:46:22,199
...very little will happen at first.

538
00:46:22,542 --> 00:46:25,568
And then a spark
will pop into existence...

539
00:46:25,745 --> 00:46:29,613
...and it will hang for an instant,
hovering in space. And then...

540
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:33,041
...it will split into two.

541
00:46:33,219 --> 00:46:34,914
And those will split again...

542
00:46:35,121 --> 00:46:36,986
...and again and again.

543
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:43,353
Detonation beyond all imagining.

544
00:46:45,364 --> 00:46:46,991
A big bang on a small scale.

545
00:46:47,166 --> 00:46:49,134
A new star born out of a dying one.

546
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:53,497
I think it'll be beautiful.

547
00:46:54,574 --> 00:46:56,633
No. I'm not scared.

548
00:47:01,747 --> 00:47:03,339
I am.

549
00:47:51,964 --> 00:47:54,558
Searle, Capa, they're waiting for you.

550
00:47:54,734 --> 00:47:56,759
Okay, let's go.

551
00:49:43,376 --> 00:49:45,901
Be careful, watch your step.

552
00:49:50,316 --> 00:49:52,341
Cassie, are you getting this
on the feed?

553
00:49:52,518 --> 00:49:54,008
Getting what?

554
00:49:54,553 --> 00:49:57,852
The air. It's full of dust.

555
00:49:58,024 --> 00:49:59,685
Human skin.

556
00:49:59,859 --> 00:50:00,951
What?

557
00:50:01,127 --> 00:50:04,392
Eighty percent of all dust
is human skin.

558
00:50:09,335 --> 00:50:11,030
Sorry.

559
00:50:15,641 --> 00:50:17,074
- No lights?
- No.

560
00:50:17,243 --> 00:50:18,471
No surprise.

561
00:50:19,979 --> 00:50:22,447
Anyone afraid of the dark?

562
00:50:23,349 --> 00:50:24,373
We should split up.

563
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:27,144
I'm not sure that's such a good idea.

564
00:50:27,653 --> 00:50:28,984
Yeah, probably right.

565
00:50:29,155 --> 00:50:32,318
Might get picked off one at a time
by aliens.

566
00:50:32,491 --> 00:50:35,927
Icarus I is a big ship. We can't search it
effectively in one group.

567
00:50:36,095 --> 00:50:38,495
Okay. You're right.

568
00:50:39,865 --> 00:50:43,062
Mace, head up for the Flight Deck,
see if you can't get her to fly.

569
00:50:44,970 --> 00:50:47,734
Searle, check the social area
and the sleeping quarters.

570
00:50:47,907 --> 00:50:49,772
Capa, aim for the payload.

571
00:50:51,310 --> 00:50:53,505
I'll check the garden.

572
00:50:53,779 --> 00:50:56,407
Let's keep in contact, guys.

573
00:51:34,186 --> 00:51:36,552
Listen up, everybody.

574
00:51:37,156 --> 00:51:40,785
You gotta see this.
Seven years of unchecked growth.

575
00:51:42,361 --> 00:51:44,352
Can you see this?

576
00:51:44,663 --> 00:51:47,791
It's an ecosystem working beautifully
after all this time.

577
00:51:47,967 --> 00:51:50,197
You seeing this readout,
O2, everybody.

578
00:51:51,137 --> 00:51:52,161
It's wonderful.

579
00:51:52,638 --> 00:51:53,662
Oh, my God.

580
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:55,739
Cory, look at the ferns.

581
00:52:11,857 --> 00:52:14,018
That's strange.

582
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:17,020
Subsystems are fine.
Solar harvest is fine.

583
00:52:17,196 --> 00:52:21,098
The ship should be running except I'm
getting nothing from the flight computer.

584
00:52:28,107 --> 00:52:29,165
Got water.

585
00:52:33,112 --> 00:52:34,602
Food.

586
00:52:40,786 --> 00:52:42,515
No crew.

587
00:52:43,122 --> 00:52:44,248
No bodies.

588
00:52:51,864 --> 00:52:53,695
My God.

589
00:52:54,767 --> 00:52:57,201
You can hardly walk, it's so thick.

590
00:53:00,873 --> 00:53:03,865
I am Pinbacker.

591
00:53:05,778 --> 00:53:08,076
Commander of the Icarus I.

592
00:53:11,817 --> 00:53:14,581
We have abandoned our mission.

593
00:53:15,754 --> 00:53:18,552
Our star is dying.

594
00:53:20,092 --> 00:53:22,583
All our science...

595
00:53:24,129 --> 00:53:26,393
...all our hopes...

596
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:31,395
...our dreams, are foolish.

597
00:53:32,171 --> 00:53:34,435
In the face of this...

598
00:53:35,274 --> 00:53:36,969
...we are...

599
00:53:37,743 --> 00:53:41,440
...dust. Nothing more.

600
00:53:41,914 --> 00:53:46,817
And to this dust, we will return.

601
00:53:50,089 --> 00:53:55,959
When he chooses for us to die.

602
00:53:56,128 --> 00:53:58,358
It is not our place...

603
00:53:59,365 --> 00:54:02,129
...to challenge God.

604
00:54:06,105 --> 00:54:08,005
Okay, that make sense to anyone?

605
00:54:08,173 --> 00:54:11,631
Transmission code is six
and a half years ago.

606
00:54:13,712 --> 00:54:16,112
That would be after they entered
the non-com zone.

607
00:54:17,082 --> 00:54:20,279
That should be the time they
were supposed to deliver the payload.

608
00:54:37,102 --> 00:54:39,662
Payload is fully operational.

609
00:54:39,838 --> 00:54:41,032
Say again, Capa?

610
00:54:41,206 --> 00:54:43,902
The payload is fully operational.
It's A-okay.

611
00:54:45,911 --> 00:54:48,880
That's great news.
Looks like we got what we came for.

612
00:54:49,048 --> 00:54:50,675
No, we don't.

613
00:54:50,849 --> 00:54:52,407
Go ahead, Mace?

614
00:54:52,618 --> 00:54:55,052
I know what caused
the distress signal.

615
00:54:55,521 --> 00:54:58,752
There's a coolant failure of some kind.
The bottom line is...

616
00:54:58,924 --> 00:55:01,825
...it doesn't matter that Capa
has his payload.

617
00:55:01,994 --> 00:55:04,428
Without the mainframe, we can't fly.

618
00:55:05,831 --> 00:55:08,026
It's been sabotaged.

619
00:55:11,437 --> 00:55:13,667
We should never have
gone off the mission.

620
00:55:31,724 --> 00:55:33,885
I have something to say.

621
00:55:35,694 --> 00:55:36,752
Found the crew.

622
00:55:58,317 --> 00:56:00,080
What happened?

623
00:56:01,954 --> 00:56:03,546
They had an epiphany.

624
00:56:04,556 --> 00:56:05,614
They saw the light.

625
00:56:06,725 --> 00:56:08,716
They burned themselves.

626
00:56:08,894 --> 00:56:10,225
No shit.

627
00:56:10,396 --> 00:56:13,763
I suspect the observation filter
is fully open.

628
00:56:13,932 --> 00:56:19,234
If we weren't behind the screen
of Icarus II, we'd join them.

629
00:56:19,805 --> 00:56:21,204
Ashes to ashes.

630
00:56:23,475 --> 00:56:25,568
Stardust to stardust.

631
00:56:26,512 --> 00:56:27,570
Icarus!

632
00:56:32,918 --> 00:56:34,442
Icarus. Stabilizers.

633
00:56:40,859 --> 00:56:43,760
- What was that?
- Guys, get back to the airlock, now.

634
00:56:49,168 --> 00:56:50,795
We have a major incident.

635
00:56:50,969 --> 00:56:52,766
We are floating free from you.

636
00:56:52,938 --> 00:56:54,667
Repeat, we are floating free.

637
00:56:55,374 --> 00:56:56,773
All crew back to the airlock.

638
00:57:09,254 --> 00:57:10,881
- Cassie.
- The airlock has decoupled.

639
00:57:11,056 --> 00:57:12,614
We don't know why.

640
00:57:12,791 --> 00:57:15,453
The locking system on Icarus I
is totally ripped open.

641
00:57:15,627 --> 00:57:18,824
I can hold our position but we aren't
gonna be able to dock again.

642
00:57:18,997 --> 00:57:20,328
There's another thing, guys.

643
00:57:20,499 --> 00:57:23,366
You've got a breach, I can see it.
You're losing atmosphere.

644
00:57:24,136 --> 00:57:25,160
We're screwed.

645
00:57:26,171 --> 00:57:27,195
No, we're not.

646
00:57:33,712 --> 00:57:35,270
One of us isn't, anyway.

647
00:57:53,499 --> 00:57:54,523
What happened?

648
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:57,692
Airlock's destroyed.
There's only one suit. Capa's taking it.

649
00:58:06,245 --> 00:58:08,679
- Why Capa?
- The rest of us are lower priority.

650
00:58:08,847 --> 00:58:10,246
I'm not a low priority.

651
00:58:10,415 --> 00:58:13,248
You're a comms officer on a ship
that has no communication.

652
00:58:13,418 --> 00:58:14,578
I am the captain.

653
00:58:15,554 --> 00:58:17,818
The mission needs a captain
to hold it together.

654
00:58:19,091 --> 00:58:22,925
Harvey, Capa's the only person outside
of Icarus who can operate the payload.

655
00:58:23,428 --> 00:58:24,520
There is no choice.

656
00:58:24,696 --> 00:58:26,220
No, there's no choice for you.

657
00:58:26,398 --> 00:58:29,231
Capa, I order you to remove that suit.

658
00:58:32,571 --> 00:58:34,436
Get out of the suit.

659
00:58:37,776 --> 00:58:40,768
That is a direct order.

660
00:58:43,482 --> 00:58:48,249
I assure you, when I'm onboard Icarus II
that I'll do everything within my power...

661
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:50,980
To what?
Shuttle back with more suits?

662
00:58:51,156 --> 00:58:52,714
The airlock is ripped in half.

663
00:58:52,891 --> 00:58:56,588
Once we break that seal,
how are we gonna re-pressurize?

664
00:59:03,268 --> 00:59:04,735
Cassie.

665
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:06,903
Go.

666
00:59:07,072 --> 00:59:10,064
Listen. We can't depressurize
when we open the airlock.

667
00:59:10,242 --> 00:59:13,109
So the force of the gas
is gonna fire him out, right?

668
00:59:13,645 --> 00:59:14,669
Right.

669
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:18,179
If you open your airlock and
we line it up right, he'll fire inside.

670
00:59:20,118 --> 00:59:21,142
And so will we.

671
00:59:24,489 --> 00:59:25,513
Without suits?

672
00:59:27,092 --> 00:59:29,822
- Get as close as you can.
- You'll have 2o meters to cover.

673
00:59:29,995 --> 00:59:32,623
At minus 273 degrees Celsius.

674
00:59:34,766 --> 00:59:36,597
It's gonna be cold.

675
00:59:37,035 --> 00:59:38,935
But we'll make it.

676
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,135
Anyone got any better ideas?

677
00:59:48,347 --> 00:59:49,678
Copy that.

678
01:00:06,198 --> 01:00:07,859
Mace.

679
01:00:08,433 --> 01:00:10,298
One problem.

680
01:00:10,836 --> 01:00:12,804
The computer's down.

681
01:00:12,971 --> 01:00:16,532
One of us has to manually
operate the seal.

682
01:00:16,842 --> 01:00:18,707
From inside.

683
01:00:19,745 --> 01:00:21,872
Shit.

684
01:00:24,082 --> 01:00:25,879
You're right.

685
01:00:26,051 --> 01:00:30,078
So, whatever happens,
one of us is staying behind.

686
01:00:32,691 --> 01:00:35,216
I see. I get it.

687
01:00:35,394 --> 01:00:38,727
It's me.
That's what you're all thinking?

688
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:42,890
No, Harvey.

689
01:00:43,068 --> 01:00:44,092
It's me.

690
01:01:05,023 --> 01:01:06,547
You okay?

691
01:01:08,026 --> 01:01:09,618
Hey, Capa.

692
01:01:10,028 --> 01:01:11,620
We're only stardust.

693
01:01:25,143 --> 01:01:26,770
Mace, we're lined up.

694
01:01:26,945 --> 01:01:29,072
Everything's set.

695
01:01:34,052 --> 01:01:35,644
Searle, are you ready?

696
01:01:38,623 --> 01:01:41,717
All right.
We only got one shot at this.

697
01:01:41,893 --> 01:01:42,917
Cassie.

698
01:01:43,528 --> 01:01:45,325
- Are you ready?
- Ready.

699
01:01:45,530 --> 01:01:49,227
Harvey, keep your eyes shut
and exhale slowly.

700
01:01:49,401 --> 01:01:50,527
Copy.

701
01:01:54,673 --> 01:01:56,140
Let's do it.

702
01:02:42,954 --> 01:02:44,615
Crew detected in airlock.

703
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:47,320
Recommend sealing
outer airlock door.

704
01:02:47,492 --> 01:02:50,052
I lost Harvey. I lost Harvey.

705
01:02:50,228 --> 01:02:52,719
- Harvey's gone.
- Crew detected in airlock.

706
01:02:53,465 --> 01:02:55,660
Sealing outer airlock door.

707
01:03:31,837 --> 01:03:33,236
Breathe, Mace. Just breathe.

708
01:03:33,405 --> 01:03:34,565
Get my hand. Get my hand.

709
01:03:34,739 --> 01:03:36,172
- Breathe, Mace.
- Capa?

710
01:03:36,341 --> 01:03:39,174
You're okay, Mace. You're okay, Mace.
Please, breathe.

711
01:03:57,529 --> 01:04:00,896
- Capa, are you all right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

712
01:04:02,467 --> 01:04:04,367
Let's get you out of here.

713
01:04:46,745 --> 01:04:48,440
Searle?

714
01:04:49,247 --> 01:04:51,078
We're leaving now.

715
01:04:55,420 --> 01:04:57,615
We're gonna complete the mission.

716
01:04:59,424 --> 01:05:01,619
We're all thinking of you, Searle.

717
01:05:02,961 --> 01:05:04,019
Searle?

718
01:05:05,096 --> 01:05:06,996
We're gonna go now.

719
01:05:12,671 --> 01:05:13,865
We love you.

720
01:05:42,133 --> 01:05:44,693
I've been through Icarus's activity file
and I checked it.

721
01:05:44,869 --> 01:05:47,030
Double-checked it.
Cory triple-checked it.

722
01:05:47,205 --> 01:05:49,571
And it's the same results.

723
01:05:50,642 --> 01:05:54,339
In other words, unless Icarus is deleting
her own files, she didn't do it.

724
01:05:54,512 --> 01:05:57,640
And there was no malfunction
on the airlock hardware.

725
01:05:57,816 --> 01:06:01,274
Which means the airlock
was decoupled manually.

726
01:06:02,354 --> 01:06:04,549
Cassie and I were on the Flight Deck.

727
01:06:04,723 --> 01:06:06,714
And I was with Capa and Searle.

728
01:06:07,192 --> 01:06:10,719
And I think we can all assume
it wasn't Harvey.

729
01:06:11,196 --> 01:06:13,528
Which leaves one possibility.

730
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:16,158
Trey.

731
01:06:16,334 --> 01:06:18,996
Trey is so doped up
he can hardly walk or feed himself.

732
01:06:19,170 --> 01:06:22,867
He sleeps for 23 hours a day.
And he blames himself for everything.

733
01:06:23,041 --> 01:06:24,599
- Why would he do it?
- We don't know.

734
01:06:24,809 --> 01:06:28,540
The possibility remains that it was
him and we gotta take that seriously.

735
01:06:28,713 --> 01:06:30,044
By doping him up more?

736
01:06:30,715 --> 01:06:35,277
This isn't just about the possibility
whether he sabotaged the airlock.

737
01:06:35,453 --> 01:06:37,717
There is something else too.

738
01:06:40,892 --> 01:06:45,420
When Searle and Harvey died,
we lost two breathers.

739
01:06:46,197 --> 01:06:48,188
If Trey dies...

740
01:06:49,234 --> 01:06:52,635
...we'll have the oxygen
to make it to the delivery point.

741
01:06:52,837 --> 01:06:55,032
At least now we know what happened
on Icarus I.

742
01:06:55,206 --> 01:06:58,471
- The same thing that's happening here.
- Fuck you, Capa.

743
01:06:58,643 --> 01:07:01,840
What are you trying to remind us of?
Our lost humanity?

744
01:07:07,218 --> 01:07:08,242
I'll do it.

745
01:07:10,055 --> 01:07:11,989
I'm not passing any bucks.

746
01:07:12,724 --> 01:07:14,487
Do it how?

747
01:07:16,061 --> 01:07:18,222
That's between me and Trey.

748
01:07:21,066 --> 01:07:23,899
We'll have a vote this time.
Unanimous decision required.

749
01:07:24,903 --> 01:07:27,565
So you know where I stand.

750
01:07:34,779 --> 01:07:35,803
And me.

751
01:07:39,250 --> 01:07:41,150
What are you asking?

752
01:07:41,820 --> 01:07:44,983
That we weigh the life of one
against the future of mankind?

753
01:07:49,761 --> 01:07:51,023
Kill him.

754
01:07:51,763 --> 01:07:53,321
Cassie?

755
01:07:57,335 --> 01:07:58,825
No.

756
01:08:02,307 --> 01:08:05,470
- Cassie.
- I know the argument.

757
01:08:05,643 --> 01:08:07,702
I know the logic.

758
01:08:08,646 --> 01:08:10,637
You're saying you need my vote.

759
01:08:10,815 --> 01:08:13,306
I'm saying you can't have it.

760
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:23,791
What do we do?

761
01:08:30,068 --> 01:08:32,195
Oh, God.

762
01:08:34,005 --> 01:08:35,734
I'm sorry, Cassie.

763
01:08:41,579 --> 01:08:44,070
You make it easy for him.

764
01:08:45,517 --> 01:08:47,246
Somehow.

765
01:08:47,886 --> 01:08:50,150
Find a kindness.

766
01:09:54,285 --> 01:09:56,014
Trey.

767
01:09:59,724 --> 01:10:02,386
Everybody get here now.

768
01:10:18,676 --> 01:10:19,734
He cut his wrists.

769
01:10:19,911 --> 01:10:22,106
He took responsibility.

770
01:10:25,617 --> 01:10:27,585
All these deaths.

771
01:10:27,752 --> 01:10:29,185
Kaneda.

772
01:10:29,354 --> 01:10:31,822
Searle. Harvey.

773
01:10:31,990 --> 01:10:33,457
Trey.

774
01:10:34,259 --> 01:10:37,751
None of them would have happened
if you hadn't diverted the mission.

775
01:10:39,564 --> 01:10:42,362
- What do you want me to say?
- I don't want you to say shit.

776
01:10:42,567 --> 01:10:45,695
I just want you to know that this...

777
01:10:45,870 --> 01:10:47,861
...belongs here.

778
01:10:50,375 --> 01:10:52,002
Fuck you.

779
01:11:11,729 --> 01:11:15,460
Air is low.
We need to limit our exertions.

780
01:11:49,233 --> 01:11:51,394
- Icarus?
- Yes, Capa?

781
01:11:51,569 --> 01:11:54,197
Run an update on biometric signs
for all crew.

782
01:11:54,372 --> 01:11:56,863
Check oxygen consumption.

783
01:11:57,508 --> 01:11:59,169
Checking.

784
01:11:59,744 --> 01:12:01,439
Thank you.

785
01:12:02,847 --> 01:12:04,576
Capa.

786
01:12:04,749 --> 01:12:06,546
- Yes?
- You are dying.

787
01:12:07,185 --> 01:12:08,777
All crew are dying.

788
01:12:08,953 --> 01:12:10,784
We know we're dying.

789
01:12:11,189 --> 01:12:14,716
As long as we can live long enough
to deliver the payload...

790
01:12:14,892 --> 01:12:16,086
...we're okay with it.

791
01:12:16,260 --> 01:12:18,854
Capa, warning.

792
01:12:19,030 --> 01:12:21,965
You will not live long enough
to deliver the payload.

793
01:12:24,769 --> 01:12:26,794
Please clarify.

794
01:12:26,971 --> 01:12:30,737
Twelve hours before crew will be unable
to perform complex tasks.

795
01:12:30,908 --> 01:12:34,571
Fourteen hours before crew will
be unable to perform basic tasks.

796
01:12:34,746 --> 01:12:36,543
Sixteen hours until death.

797
01:12:36,714 --> 01:12:38,204
Journey time to delivery point:

798
01:12:38,383 --> 01:12:40,783
- Nineteen hours.
- Impossible. Corazon was certain.

799
01:12:40,952 --> 01:12:43,284
We have remaining oxygen
to keep four crew alive.

800
01:12:43,454 --> 01:12:46,389
Affirmative. Four crew could
survive on current reserves...

801
01:12:46,557 --> 01:12:48,923
Trey is dead.
There are only four crew members.

802
01:12:49,093 --> 01:12:50,117
Negative.

803
01:12:50,294 --> 01:12:53,229
Affirmative, Icarus. Four crew:
Mace, Cassie, Corazon and me.

804
01:12:53,398 --> 01:12:55,423
Five crew members.

805
01:13:00,905 --> 01:13:02,429
Icarus?

806
01:13:02,607 --> 01:13:04,199
Yes?

807
01:13:06,711 --> 01:13:08,008
Who's the fifth crew member?

808
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:11,009
Unknown.

809
01:13:13,351 --> 01:13:15,683
Where is the fifth crew member?

810
01:13:15,853 --> 01:13:18,651
In the Observation Room.

811
01:13:57,528 --> 01:13:59,860
Are you an angel?

812
01:14:02,366 --> 01:14:04,391
Has the time come?

813
01:14:08,072 --> 01:14:10,870
I've been waiting so long.

814
01:14:17,815 --> 01:14:19,544
Who are you?

815
01:14:21,319 --> 01:14:22,877
Who am I?

816
01:14:29,393 --> 01:14:31,793
At the end of time...

817
01:14:32,530 --> 01:14:36,557
...a moment will come
when just one man remains.

818
01:14:38,236 --> 01:14:40,101
Then the moment will pass.

819
01:14:42,507 --> 01:14:44,941
The man will be gone.

820
01:14:47,845 --> 01:14:51,611
There will be nothing to show
as if we were ever here...

821
01:14:52,617 --> 01:14:55,017
...but stardust.

822
01:14:57,054 --> 01:15:01,718
The last man, alone with God.

823
01:15:04,695 --> 01:15:07,186
Am I that man?

824
01:15:21,445 --> 01:15:23,072
My God.

825
01:15:26,083 --> 01:15:29,109
My God, Pinbacker?

826
01:15:30,054 --> 01:15:32,249
Not your God.

827
01:15:32,423 --> 01:15:34,084
Mine.

828
01:15:47,772 --> 01:15:49,603
Icarus. Full sunlight.

829
01:16:06,824 --> 01:16:07,882
Anyone.

830
01:17:03,547 --> 01:17:05,071
Oh, my God.

831
01:17:05,516 --> 01:17:06,540
Icarus?

832
01:17:13,457 --> 01:17:16,255
Warning, you do not have
authority to remove...

833
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:18,724
...the mainframe panels
from the coolant.

834
01:17:18,896 --> 01:17:21,660
Please return the panels
to the coolant.

835
01:17:21,832 --> 01:17:25,563
I cannot locate
your biometric signs.

836
01:17:25,770 --> 01:17:29,035
Please identify yourself.

837
01:17:51,696 --> 01:17:54,426
You gotta be kidding.

838
01:18:11,282 --> 01:18:13,375
My God.

839
01:18:21,659 --> 01:18:23,627
A baby.

840
01:18:25,596 --> 01:18:27,223
A beautiful baby.

841
01:18:27,398 --> 01:18:29,889
Icarus, patch me through to Mace.
I have something...

842
01:18:30,067 --> 01:18:31,591
...wonderful to show him.

843
01:18:31,769 --> 01:18:34,260
Or Cassie or Capa.

844
01:18:35,072 --> 01:18:36,733
Icarus?

845
01:18:41,645 --> 01:18:43,545
Don't fight.

846
01:18:44,849 --> 01:18:46,749
Don't fight.

847
01:19:18,949 --> 01:19:20,678
Mace?

848
01:19:56,187 --> 01:19:57,313
Capa?

849
01:19:58,656 --> 01:20:01,352
Is anyone else getting silence
from Icarus?

850
01:20:03,861 --> 01:20:05,829
Anybody?

851
01:20:20,945 --> 01:20:22,708
Capa?

852
01:20:52,209 --> 01:20:54,769
Icarus, why are we in orbit?

853
01:20:57,448 --> 01:20:58,676
Respond.

854
01:21:01,986 --> 01:21:03,044
What?

855
01:21:03,220 --> 01:21:04,380
Jesus Christ.

856
01:21:05,122 --> 01:21:06,783
Capa? Capa?

857
01:21:10,494 --> 01:21:11,756
In the suit.

858
01:21:11,929 --> 01:21:13,396
Use the hard link.

859
01:21:13,564 --> 01:21:14,656
In the helmet.

860
01:21:14,832 --> 01:21:16,424
Mace?

861
01:21:20,204 --> 01:21:21,933
- What the hell is going on?
- Mace?

862
01:21:22,106 --> 01:21:23,801
I can't talk to Icarus.

863
01:21:23,974 --> 01:21:27,307
Pinbacker is onboard.
He's trying to stop the mission.

864
01:21:27,478 --> 01:21:30,311
He's trying to destroy the mission.
He's insane.

865
01:21:42,526 --> 01:21:44,494
Mace, listen.
I'm locked in the airlock.

866
01:21:44,662 --> 01:21:47,597
Jesus Christ.
The mainframe is out of the coolant.

867
01:21:53,304 --> 01:21:54,862
The mechanism is disabled.

868
01:21:55,039 --> 01:21:56,802
I can't lower the mainframe panels.

869
01:21:56,974 --> 01:21:58,839
Mace, repeat, please.

870
01:22:00,311 --> 01:22:02,370
Icarus is gonna burn out.

871
01:22:05,382 --> 01:22:06,440
Mace.

872
01:22:06,650 --> 01:22:08,345
Mace, come in.

873
01:24:35,432 --> 01:24:36,990
Come on.

874
01:24:41,839 --> 01:24:43,329
Capa.

875
01:24:43,507 --> 01:24:44,531
- Capa.
- Mace?

876
01:24:45,275 --> 01:24:47,766
We're in orbit. The computer is down.

877
01:24:48,645 --> 01:24:51,808
I don't know if I can get her
back online.

878
01:24:51,982 --> 01:24:55,782
You have to break us out
of orbit manually.

879
01:24:55,953 --> 01:24:57,511
The only way to do that...

880
01:24:57,688 --> 01:25:00,657
...is separate the payload.
Do you get it, Capa?

881
01:25:00,824 --> 01:25:03,622
Force the bomb into the sun.

882
01:25:04,428 --> 01:25:05,861
Separate the payload.

883
01:25:06,363 --> 01:25:10,891
You'll have to get to the bomb
and detonate manually.

884
01:25:11,068 --> 01:25:13,559
Unlock the airlock, do you copy?
Unlock the airlock.

885
01:25:14,138 --> 01:25:17,835
I don't know how, just do it.
Just do it.

886
01:25:19,042 --> 01:25:20,669
Okay.

887
01:25:21,044 --> 01:25:23,376
I'm gonna do this.

888
01:25:24,248 --> 01:25:25,840
Copy, Mace.

889
01:25:27,317 --> 01:25:29,012
Copy.

890
01:26:25,876 --> 01:26:27,241
Capa.

891
01:26:27,411 --> 01:26:29,436
My leg.

892
01:26:43,594 --> 01:26:45,289
Oh, God.

893
01:26:52,669 --> 01:26:54,933
Do it, Capa.

894
01:27:00,110 --> 01:27:01,634
Do it.

895
01:27:07,851 --> 01:27:08,909
Mace.

896
01:31:50,901 --> 01:31:52,425
Come on.

897
01:32:50,126 --> 01:32:52,151
Only dream I ever have.

898
01:32:52,462 --> 01:32:53,929
Is it the surface of the sun?

899
01:32:55,332 --> 01:32:58,665
Every time I shut my eyes
it's always the same.

900
01:35:00,757 --> 01:35:02,384
Cassie?

901
01:35:10,900 --> 01:35:12,492
Cassie?

902
01:35:12,669 --> 01:35:13,931
We're flying into the sun.

903
01:35:17,774 --> 01:35:19,935
Cassie, there's not much time.
I need to know.

904
01:35:20,110 --> 01:35:21,577
Where is he? Is he here?

905
01:35:28,084 --> 01:35:31,918
For seven years I spoke with God.

906
01:35:39,329 --> 01:35:42,856
He told me to take us all to heaven.

907
01:35:49,572 --> 01:35:51,130
No.

908
01:36:34,717 --> 01:36:36,378
Finish it.

909
01:37:55,398 --> 01:37:56,695
Let's say 25. Set at 25.

910
01:38:09,145 --> 01:38:10,339
Please.

911
01:38:10,513 --> 01:38:11,980
Please.

912
01:40:02,925 --> 01:40:05,723
Hi, sis.

913
01:40:06,696 --> 01:40:08,755
Kiss the kids.

914
01:40:17,640 --> 01:40:18,766
You guys, come on.

915
01:40:19,475 --> 01:40:21,272
It's time.

916
01:40:26,716 --> 01:40:28,581
So if you wake up one morning...

917
01:40:28,751 --> 01:40:33,154
...and it's a particularly beautiful day,
you'll know we made it.

918
01:40:35,725 --> 01:40:37,283
Okay.

919
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:39,460
I'm signing out.

920
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:43,098
