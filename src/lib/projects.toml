Horizon is an experimental project developped as part of an exchange program at the Future University of Hakodate, in the north of Japan.
Presented as an audiovisual installation during the annual exhibition of the lab, it showcases continuous a sci-fi movie scene, using only generative techniques for its graphics.
The methods used for rendering the images were directly inspired by the demoscene community, where no disrete geometry is used - pixels are mostly the result of mathematical functions, allowing to bend the rules of physics.
At times, to further evoke a movie scene, the setup picks and displays random quotes from subtitle tracks of actual sci-fi movie."""

Unsettled Music is a series of web experiments dedicated to showcasing some of the creative research happening at Qosmo Inc. on sound, graphics, and machine learning.

Works shared as part of the series aren't meant to explore their subject thoroughly â€” they are more like snapshots of an idea, with humble ambitions.
Exploring the outskirts of AI techniques often leads to unusual outputs - this weirdness is at the core of the project."""
